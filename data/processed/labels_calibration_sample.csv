Around 14,000 Mw of projects, involving Rs 300 bn of its loan book, under IBC route and over half of them may have to be written off
premium
State-owned Power Finance Corporation (PFC) could see around 11.4 per cent of its loan book getting into the insolvency route. This includes debt-laden thermal power projects, stranded gas and hydro power units.
Officials said 14,115 Mw of capacity, at an estimated Rs 300 billion exposure to PFC, will go under insolvency proceedings.
In fact, a total of 3,255 Mw projects, have already been taken to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) by either PFC or one of the key bankers among the consortium of lenders, an official said. Rest of the projects, around 10,000 Mw, have six months for resolution. The time is too little, given the regulatory hurdles, he added. So, the remaining 10,000 Mw of projects could also land up in NCLT.
Those already before NCLT under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) include the Konaseema gas power plant (445 Mw), coal projects of East Coast Power (1,320 Mw), KVK Nilachal (350 Mw), Ind-Barath Madras (660 Mw), Krishna Godavari (360 Mw) and the hydro power plant of JAL in Sikkim (120 Mw).
The bigger worry is about projects which have six months or less to get resolved or land before NCLT. A recent Reserve Bank of India (RBI) notification, titled ‘Resolution of stressed assets — Revised framework’, mandates banks to classify even a one-day delay in debt servicing as default. And, that resolution proceedings against stressed accounts are to be completed in 180 days. Though the directive is to banks and PFC is a non-banking financing company, its assets also get covered by this, since PFC loans are in a consortium with banks.

“I will eventually bequeath my Yes Bank Promoter shares to my three daughters and subsequently to their children, with a request in my Will stating not to sell a single share, as Diamonds are Forever,” he said.
Earlier this month, the RBI had trimmed Kapoor’s term as the CEO and MD of YES Bank and has asked him to step down after January 31, 2019.

The real estate subsidiary of the Shriram group has hired Axis Bank Ltd, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities Ltd and Edelweiss Financial Services to manage the share sale, its managing director Murali Malayappan said.
Murali, however, declined to give a specific timeline for filing the draft prospectus, but said the company plans to launch the IPO before the end of this financial year.
“We are in a preparatory stage to file documents before the end of this year,” said Gopal Krishnan, executive director and chief financial officer, Shriram Properties.
“We have started working with bankers and lawyers exploring opportunities for capital raising and, hopefully, we will test the market soon,” Krishnan said.
An Axis Bank spokesperson declined to comment, while queries sent to Nomura and Edelweiss remained unanswered.
Private equity firms TPG Capital, Starwood Capital, Walton Street Capital and Tata Capital, which hold a combined 58% stake in Shriram Properties, will partly monetize their shares in the company through the proposed IPO, said Krishnan.
“The IPO will provide the kind of liquidity that our investors would be looking at. So all will be monetizing their existing positions. It will be a good liquidity from their perspective as well,” he said.
This year, real estate companies Lodha Group and Puranik Builders Ltd have filed documents to launch IPOs.
The last time a private real estate firm launched an IPO was in 2010. That year, several companies, such as DB Realty Ltd, Prestige Estates Projects Ltd, Oberoi Realty Ltd, Nitesh Estates Ltd and Man Infraconstruction Ltd, had collectively raised around ₹ 4,275 crore.
“(The) economy is growing. We see a good demand. There is no slowdown (for good developers),” said Murali. “Customers are choosing to buy homes from good developers. The market has been able to differentiate who can deliver and who cannot,” he said.
Shriram Properties plans to rapidly expand and has adopted an asset light model of development management (DM) to ramp up its residential portfolio. It is also actively looking at acquiring distressed assets to strengthen its property businesses in existing markets, including Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad.
Under the DM model, large realty firms step in as development managers for smaller developers and landowners in return for a share of the revenue, share of profit or a management fee.
“In this changing landscape, we have taken the DM route as a model to grow in an asset light way, and at the same time scale up quickly. We are giving greater emphasis on the DM model, which has gained large share of our portfolio now,” said Krishnan.
Till 2017-18, Shriram had one project under DM. However, in the last one year, it has signed a dozen such projects and this is likely to comprise a third of its upcoming project pipeline, Krishnan said.",review_promoted,credit

“Large overseas intuitional investors are likely to have bought those papers from a domestic house,” said a dealer with knowledge of the deals.
Yields on NBFC bonds are showing signs of surging after BJP MP Subramanian Swamy alleged that Indiabulls Housing, a non-banking financier of homes, was involved in siphoning off funds to the tune of more than Rs 1 lakh crore.
Bonds of stressed financier Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL) also changed hands in two separate secondary-market transactions of Rs 25 crore each on Monday. Those deals yielded 50-51 per cent, compared with 38-39 per cent more than a month ago, dealers said.
“Large overseas intuitional investors are likely to have bought those papers from a domestic house,” said a dealer with knowledge of the deals. The instruments were long-term bonds the company had sold through public issuance last year.
Bond yields rise when prices fall.
Even a few foreign banks reportedly offered to bid Indiabulls Housing Finance bonds at 15 per cent. But there were no sellers (at that yield) after the company denied allegations of funds diversion through the National Housing Bank (NHB) window. Indiabulls Housing said it has no outstanding with NHB, the lender and regulator for home financiers.
""Loans outstanding as on date from NHB to Indiabulls Housing are zero,"" Indiabulls Housing said late Sunday evening. ""Indiaibulls Housing, in its history, has never taken any loan or refinancing facility from NHB.""
Swamy alleged that the company should be probed by federal agencies for shipping funds out of the country.
Following the start of defaults at infrastructure conglomerate IL&FS last September, NBFCs and home financiers have been struggling to raise money. During the period, their funding costs have surged 150-200 basis points on an average.
Meanwhile, bond deals are limited in an illiquid market.
“Some large overseas investors are offering to buy bonds cheap whenever any negativity hits the market,” said Ajay Manglunia, MD and head-institutional fixed income, JM Financial. “Some existing investors, who may be in a hurry to exit, are seen selling those papers. But there is no panic situation in the market.”
The Indiabulls Housing Finance and Lakshmi Vilas Bank are in the process of merging their businesses.

RBI monetary policy live updates: Here’s what Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak Mahindra AMC, said on RBI’s latest decisions
From being a part of fragile 5 some time back to having GDP growth revised upwards to 7% when global growth has become fragile is the summary of the good work done by the RBI and the government in the most challenging times.
The RBI policy is continuity of the good work done in the past. Inflation within target range, yet the vigil is on. Growth revised upwards. Financial system healthy and pushed to stay ahead of the curve on digitisation. Truly reminding of Glen Maxwell Inning against Afghanistan in the world cup.

RBI monetary policy live updates: Rahul Bajoria, MD & Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics, Barclays, said on MPC’s latest decisions
On all counts, we found the policy bias to continue to be hawkish, but the extent of this hawkishness appears to have been dialled back, indicating comfort with the current period of high growth and manageable underlying inflation. We think this also signals no pressing need for the RBI to change policy direction, as the economy appears to be in a Goldilocks environment, with the three bears of fragile global demand, tight global monetary conditions, and ongoing supply/commodity price shocks receding to the background.

The policy outcome is largely neutral for bonds and we see markets to stay range bound amid low year-end liquidity, with ten year yield hovering 7.20-7.30%. However, RBI’s consistent concern on skewness of liquidity distribution in the banking system has now led them to allow reversal of liquidity facility under both SDF and MSF even on weekends.
Overall, the policy tone was comfortable, while MPC still insisting on keeping an eye on inflation and financial stability risk and active liquidity management.
We maintain the RBI will stay vigilant, and it is unlikely to precede the Fed in any policy reversal in CY24.

RBI monetary policy live updates: Here’s what Anuj Puri, Chairman, ANAROCK Group, said on interest rate decision
The housing market is on a bull run and unchanged home loan rates will only add to the overall positive consumer sentiments. Additionally, given that housing prices have escalated across the top 7 cities in the last one year, at least the unchanged home loan rates will give some relief to the homebuyers.
We expect the momentum in housing sales to continue in the wake of the unchanged repo rates coupled with the resultant stable home loan rates and positive economic outlook on India.

RBI monetary policy live updates: Indian bond yields seen flat ahead of cenbank policy decision
Indian government bond yields are likely to be largely unchanged on Friday in the run-up to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) monetary policy decision, with focus on future guidance.
The 10-year benchmark bond yield is expected to be between 7.22% and 7.25%, till the announcement that starts at 10:00 a.m. IST, after ending the previous session at 7.2528%, a trader with a state-run bank said.
“With no move in rates and stances expected, the whole focus would be on the language used by the central bank officials. If they want to hint at prolonged tightness, they could go for an upward revision in growth as well as inflation predictions,” the trader said.
The central bank will hold the key policy rate at 6.50% for a fifth consecutive meeting, according to a Reuters poll, and traders anticipate a hawkish undertone to the policy guidance.
The preference will be to gradually withdraw incremental liquidity and undertake a targeted approach via macro-prudential measures to check excesses, as demonstrated by the recent move to tighten risk weights on consumer loans, DBS said. (Reuters)

RBI monetary policy live updates: Here’s what Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, said on Reserve Bank’s MPC preview
India’s growth resilience beat expectations. Developments since the Oct’23 policy meet suggest the domestic economy is going strong. The latest GDP growth (7.6%) exceeded consensus (6.8%) and our expectations (6.9%), primarily driven by investments while consumption growth was tepid. We reckon the coming period will see a reversal in the contributors to growth, from investment to consumption, as competitive populism would shift the focus of government spending from capital to revenue expenditure, while private investments are likely to be subdued ahead of the general elections.
Global growth slowing; soft landing for the US now a possibility. Heading toward end-2023, global growth is clearly decelerating. Amid such uncertainty, the case for a soft landing for the US has improved, where growth is relatively strong, easing labour markets and core inflation moderating. This has helped yields sliding and DXY easing, leading to FPI flows in Nov’23 turning positive.
Core inflation well on track; volatile food prices a concern. Headline inflation has been tracking downward, with core inflation in Oct’23 shrinking for the fourth straight month. Active supply-side measures and no change in fuel prices at the pump ensured headline was well in control. Ahead, we think some of this moderation will be un-done with food prices again rising and lower reservoir levels affecting the rabi output in 2024.
Liquidity in deficit. While the governor at the last meeting highlighted the possibility of OMO sales, liquidity has been in deficit through Nov, with overnight rates hovering around the MSF.
RBI to continue its pause. Taken together, as inflation is still a concern and growth strong, the RBI will pause, letting rate hikes work their way through the system. With liquidity in deficit, there is no need for OMO sales although the RBI would rely on active liquidity management. We will be watching out for the Governor’s commentary on adjusted risk weights and retail credit portfolio. While we expect no change in the liquidity stance, the commentary is likely to be neutral.

RBI monetary policy live updates: Any major tweaks in the approach to liquidity could impact bond yields, say traders
At its last policy review in October, the central bank said it may consider open market operation (OMO) based bond sales to keep liquidity tight but these sales have not happened, per a Reuters reprot.
Any major tweaks in the approach to liquidity could impact bond yields, traders said.
“We do not expect any explicit measure to be announced to tighten financial conditions, but RBI may sound cautious,” said Abhishek Upadhyay, a senior economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.
“The RBI may not signal any discomfort on the current tightness in banking system liquidity. They may continue to keep the optimality of OMO sales open to manage liquidity and financial conditions,” he added.

The swap markets are signalling that the Indian central bank will only begin cutting rates in the middle of 2024, at least a quarter after the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to start loosening policy, per a Reuters report.
“The focus will remain on keeping liquidity conditions tight, to enhance transmission of past rate hikes and prevent generalisation of price pressures,” said Gaura Sen Gupta, an economist with IDFC First Bank.

RBI monetary policy live updates: RBI likely to retain 6.5% interest rate as inflation in check, say experts
The Reserve Bank of India is likely to maintain the status quo on the short-term interest rate in its monetary policy review, with inflation staying in comfort zone and economic growth moving at an accelerated pace, opined experts. The RBI has left the repo rate unchanged in its past four bi-monthly monetary policies. The central bank had last increased the repo rate in February to 6.5 per cent, thus ending the interest rate hiking spree which began in May 2022 in the aftermath of Russia-Ukraine war and subsequent disruptions in the global supply chain resulting in high inflation in the country.
On expectations from the RBI’s monetary policy, Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda, said the central bank is most likely to maintain the status quo on rates as well as stance this time.
“The high growth witnessed in Q2 in GDP will provide assurance that the economy is on track. The low core inflation numbers in the last few months will provide comfort that there is no need to increase rates even while headline inflation is likely to be volatile in the upward direction,” he said.
“Some direction on liquidity will be useful to the market as the system is in deficit for quite some time,” he said and added there can be some upward revision in the GDP growth numbers though will not be very significant.
Aurodeep Nandi, India economist at Nomura, also expects the MPC to unanimously vote to pause at its December policy meeting. (PTI)

India consolidated its position as the fastest-growing major economy globally as the Government’s Statistics office on Thursday released the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for second quarter spanning July to September months of the financial year 2023-24.
The data showed that Indian economy has grown by 7.6 per cent during Q2 FY24 mainly on account of strong performance by industries. It is much higher than the projection of the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) last month.

RBI monetary policy live updates: Retail inflation eases to 4-month low at 4.87% in October
A supportive base and moderation in non-food prices pushed headline retail inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to a four-month low of 4.87 per cent in October. It was 5.02 per cent in September. Incidentally, the June print was also 4.87 per cent.
Core inflation (headline inflation minus inflation of food and fuel) also dropped to 4.23 per cent from 4.52 per cent.
Swati Arora, an economist with HDFC Bank, said persistence in pulses and cereal inflation is worrisome and poses an upside risk to food prices. “CPI inflation is expected to clock a print above 5 per cent both in November and December and average around 5 per cent in Q4 FY24,” she said.
Upasna Bhardwaj, Chief Economist, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said: “We expect the trend of sub-5 per cent headline inflation to remain brief, with most of FY24 ahead likely to remain above 5 per cent.”

Addressing a press conference on Friday, Rajya Sabha MP asserted that the issue of electoral bonds would not be investigated by any probe agencies.
""ED and CBI are sleeping right now. If this thing happens against the Opposition they would have taken action. They have taken an overdose of sleeping pills. You must remember because I don't, that someone (referring to PM Modi) said 'na khaoga na khane dunga'. What happened to that? Someone (PM Modi) said that they would bring black money from the Swiss bank and transfer Rs 15 lakh each to people's accounts, but it seems like they have transferred that money to their accounts. In my opinion, this will not be investigated by any probe agencies. Now the responsibility is on the Court to determine what will they do and what action they will take,"" Sibal said.
He further said that the two major scams that have taken place in the country, are demonetization and another scam is of electoral bonds.
""Like the court done in the 2G case, where an SIT was made, in this case also an SIT should be constituted to probe the matter. We have to see how the law will see it now...It should also be found out who donated to the PM-CARES. It's a matter of investigation which party got how many funds,"" he added.
He further asserted that there are a lot of gaps in the investigation.
""There are a lot of gaps in investigation. It should also be investigated who all donated to the PM Cares fund. That's too a big issue,"" he added.
Meanwhile, data uploaded by the Election Commission of India on its website on Thursday showed that Future Gaming and Hotel Services, whose director is the lottery magnate Santiago Martin, is the top purchaser of electoral bonds having purchased bonds worth Rs 1368 crore. The data relates to a period from 2019-2024.

As per the company website Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Limited (MEIL) is a major infrastructure company headquartered in Hyderabad, India.

The poll panel uploaded details of electoral bonds submitted by the State Bank of India in two parts. The first part includes the name of the purchaser of the electoral bond, date, and denomination. The second list has the date of encashment, name of the political party and denomination.
The Election Commission issued a press note and referred to the directions of the Supreme Court while putting out the electoral bond data.
""In compliance of the Hon'ble Supreme Court's directions, contained in its order dated Feb 15 and March 11, 2024 (in the matter of WPC NO.880 of 2017), the State Bank of India (SBI) had provided the data pertaining to the electoral bonds to the Election Commission of India (ECI) on March 12, 2024,"" the press note said.
The poll panel said that it has ""consistently and categorically weighed in favour of disclosure and transparency"", a position reflected in the proceedings of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and noted in the order also.

However, last year the US Treasury benchmark hovered broadly in the range of 1-1.5 per cent, luring many local companies to borrow overseas. Shriram Transport Finance and Indiabulls Housing Finance are among others with an outstanding debt to international investors.
“Another area of focus has been the build-up of debt among non-financial corporates, rising dollar-denominated debt in emerging market economies (EMEs) and the role of NBFIs,” the RBI report said.
“In sum, synchronised monetary tightening amidst heightened geopolitical tensions poses several financial stability risks,” it said.
Those risks include sell-offs of financial assets, rise in interest rates and market dislocations. Increasingly investors raise doubts over debt servicing capability.
Some Indian papers have yielded as much as 20 per cent in the offshore market in recent times.
“The likely erosion of risk appetite and tighter financial conditions could increase debt-servicing costs at a time when their ability to generate foreign exchange to service debt appears to be more constrained,” the FSR report said.
However, there is one silver lining. Even as the Chinese high-yield market is strewn with defaults, Indian high-yield papers appear to be a destination for global investors with higher risk appetites.

- Mutual funds need NBFCs as badly as NBFCs needmutual funds.
- Mutual funds lost Rs 1 lakh crore AUM in fixed income in last one year.
- I do not think any smart NBFC will even see the growth coming down.
Edited excerpts:
A lot of commercial papers are due for rollover in November. Mutual funds have hit their sectoral limits. What is going to happen now?
I do not think that view is correct. I do not think mutual funds have hit the sectoral limits.
That is what we read and what brokerages are telling us.
You should change the brokerage report which you read because I do not think there is a big issue in rollovers. Let me give you some perspective on this NBFC issue which started a couple of months back. The first thing people should understand is that the way the most of the NBFCs are structured in India. With a 15% capital adequacy requirement, your debt to equity cannot be more than 6 times. If you are slightly more conservative, you will keep it 4.5 to 5 times. NBFCs do not go insolvent on the asset side issues.
At 4.5-5 times debt to equity, your losses have to be 25% of your book for you to go insolvent. 25% is equity and 75% is debt and therefore 25% losses. In 08-09 also when there was a huge economic issue worldwide, the NPAs were 3-4%. We are a long, long way from 25% NPAs and therefore most of the NBFCs will be solvent.
When the company is solvent, it can only face the refinance issue if some issue comes up. Most of the NBFCs are there in the market for the last 10-12 years, from 2008 at least. The situation today is nothing compared to what it was in 2008-2009. They would have seen 2013 also. Any NBFC which has seen 2008-09 and 2013 understands that capital market is a very fair-weather friend. Capital market likes you, you get lots of money. Capital market does not like you, you do not get too much money. Therefore you need some backup of bank lines.
Would you be rolling over all your exposure in NBFCs as a mutual fund? As NBFCs may face asset-liability mismatch, mutual funds who were readily giving money to NBFCs may turn reluctant now. Do you agree? If not, why?
NBFCs have the 15% capital adequacy norm, decent promoter backgrounds, a decent asset book and therefore mutual funds were very keen to participate in NBFC sector because that was the only sector which was taking money. That is not going to change. If you suddenly think that NBFCs will go below and banks will come up, I have my doubts.
NBFCs will continue to be a large player when the credit demand picks up. Some banks have equity shortage and some banks have deposit shortage. Some banks are under PCA. Some private sector banks are seeing leadership changes.
Net-net, NBFCs will continue to be the dominant player and they are a very smart set of people. The only drawback for the NBFC promoters is that they are focused on the asset side. They will put a huge amount of effort to make out what NPA I make, which sectors I lend to. Only a few promoters are equally focused on the liability side. When I meet the promoters, they are saying assets can wait, let me look at the liability side. Once they handle the liability side equally well, things will be perfectly fine.
But from equity market perspective, you guys are asking me the wrong question. The cost of equity is going to go up and if the cost of equity goes up with the same ROE and growth rate, equity prices can fall by as much as 20-25%, with the cost of equity going up by 1 percentage point.
That is classic Buffett. Interest rates “act on financial valuations the way gravity acts on matter: The higher the rate, the greater the downward pull.”
But people do not realise 1% higher cost of equity with the same ROE and growth can pull your prices down by 25%. Same ROE, same cost of equity, 1% growth coming down can pull your prices 15% down. So people do not understand so much importance has to be given to cost of equity. And what is the cost of equity? Cost of equity is nothing but cost of debt plus something. If the cost of debt goes up, cost of equity also goes up and prices come down.
Do you think there is a systemic risk in place or did we just overplay it to a great extent and confidence is now coming back?
If you suddenly stop the raw material supply -- any industry, be it is steel or power or coal, will experience disaster. If nobody lends to NBFCs or banks, obviously there is going to be a huge systemic issue. But all those exceptional things work for a couple of days and then sanity prevails and things start coming back to normal.
I was very happy when RBI and NHB came into the picture. When three or four large regulators come in and say that they are watching it carefully and will do what is necessary, I think things should be okay and exactly that has happened.
I do not think anyone has put a large line. So, obviously banks are buying some pools from HFCs. But because of the way it has come out, confidence has come up, mutual funds are giving new money and everything is going perfectly fine. About 70-80% fine.
As a house, do you have exposure to IL&FS?
No.
Mutual funds have 10 lakh, 11 lakh crores of total credit book. Some are AAA, some are AA plus and some are AA. If one IL&FS happens, obviously it is a bit negative but it happens in all the markets. You have G-Sec prices coming down by 10%. You have equity markets falling off by 10%.
My job is to first clear the air.
We do not have any exposure but do not give overweight either. Obviously IL&FS has some impact but is it a huge impact that is going to impact the entire mutual fund industry? Definitely no.
Well I did not do it, it was some mutual fund which sold DHFL paper at 13% that had created the panic. So, obviously the IL&FS issue had an impact?
Let me clarify that. Once equity is getting sold at X percentage, it is not a big thing because the markets are not very liquid. We had an open-ended fund. Suddenly you see a large redemption happening, you need to sell at a price and if that price is 1% higher on a one-year paper, I make 1% haircut and sell it off. Because it came in the background of IL&FS and all that, it became too much of a noise but otherwise it was mutual fund selling something because redemptions are getting hit. If you need to reduce your exposure, that 1% is not a big deal. But if it comes in the background of IL&FS default, then obviously the noise gets louder. But I do not think that is a big issue.
As NBFCs slow down, I expect corporate banks will start gaining some market share. Where would the aggregate picture grow? Where is the middle path for credit growth?
The NBFC industry will slow down but smarter NBFCs will take this opportunity and grow faster than the rate at which they were growing. Whenever there is a bit of negativity, a large amount of money goes to NBFCs where the perception is very good.
Those NBFCs that were growing at 25%, may grow at 28% now because more money is chasing them and they are very smart NBFCs. I have been dealing with them for the last 15-20 years. I do not think any smart NBFC will even see the growth coming down. But having said that, the bigger picture we are missing is that generally the economy will face a significant headwind going forward.
One huge data point worldwide has got unnoticed. China after running a 10% current account surplus in 2008, saw a current account deficit in the last quarter. Can you imagine the impact of China’s current account deficit? That will impact the currency of China and that in turn will have an impact on the emerging market currencies including ours.
Those are the bigger issues. NBFCs will come and go but if your macroeconomic headwinds are high, growth is very good, if your assets are going up, if our currency is depreciating, we will have other things to worry about rather than the NBFC issue.
Were we a little bit late in the curve in terms of spotting what has happened or what unfolded?
Slowly the panic spread is coming down. Over a period of time, it will come to close to zero. But having said that, it is not very well-known that mutual funds lost Rs 1 lakh crore AUM in fixed income in last one year. That is a large amount. If the economy is growing, you would need more credit to go to the economy. On the other hand, mutual funds are losing Rs 1 lakh crore. We got extraordinary money when demonetisation happened and the money is going back. Liquidity is a bit tight and this money will go off, week on week, month on month, fixed income funds have been losing assets. Therefore, while the panic spreads will keep coming down and become zero, the normal or the credit spreads will keep widening because mutual funds are the biggest and fast movers both on upside and downside.
As you said, some mutual funds getting redemption will have to sell it. For corporate paper at 1% higher yield, they will go and sell it and they will move very fast. I suspect the bigger problem is the cost of spreads going up, cost of debt going up, cost of equity going up and on top of that, elections are coming up.
Why were there challenges with some liquid schemes also? That just creates panic. What would be your message for someone who has kept money in liquid fund because liquid fund by default are programmed not to lose money?
You can say that but my view is if you lend to anyone other than Government of India, there is some chance of a default happening. Even if the chance is low, even if it is AAA. If you do not want defaults to happen, please go and do a CBLO fund or a T-bill fund. If you are lending to any company which is not government of India, obviously there is some chance of losing money.
IL&FS was a big issue because it was a AAA rated entity which went into default. If it was a lower rated entity, the default was perfectly okay. Somebody can ask why did a AAA entity go to default? I am not here to justify what credit rating agencies do but I have worked with a credit rating agency and I can give you some colour on what would have happened in IL&FS.
When a credit rating agency looks at a company and says what ratings should we give, there are two broad things they look at; one is how good the financiers are and whether they would get their money back purely on the cash flows.
If the chances are very high, I will get a higher rating and if the chances are low, I will get a lower rating. Apart from this, they will say who are the promoters of this company. A strong promoter and a weak finance can give you a very high rating because the promoters have shown over a long period of time that they can keep putting in equity and debt and therefore if large industrial houses of the country have a slightly weak company. That company gets a higher rating.
In IL&FS, because the promoters were government of India entities, the belief was if there is a short-term mismatch because these are large, AAA rated companies, they would come and put some equity or they can help with some of the financing. Now it is a zero one game. Till the time you believe that will happen, the rating can be very high. The day that belief goes off, the rating can be low.
In this case, the belief was because of the promoter background, the rating was kept high. Now it is debatable whether it should have been a AAA or a AA+ but the rating was high because it is a zero one game, you cannot have a sliding kind of rating. Therefore there was issue.
Should the fear about select NBFCs going belly up because of liquidity crunch or non-availability of CP paper in the market, be dismissed?
We cannot say for everyone but for majority of the players that is behind us now that the panic spread is coming down to nearly zero. But having said so, there could be a couple of names which will be the last one to come up. Do not ask what the names are but 80-90% of the industry is perfectly fine. 5% of the industry will take six months more but can a default happen there? I am not sure. But again, accidents can happen at any point of time. It is a non zero probability but that probability is very low now.
Do you think mutual funds are not likely to reduce their commitment towards CP?
Mutual funds are very competitive animals. If I do not lend to a new company and I keep money in CBLO, I get 6.25% as the yield. If I lend to a decent NBFC, I get 8.50%. A 200% point difference between an overnight and two-month, three-month CP can lose my one-year bonus. Obviously on a huge amount of panic fear, that will go off but as soon as a bit of comfort comes up, one mutual fund comes in, the second comes in, the third comes and a over a period, everything will come back.
Where do you think the 10-year paper would settle eventually?
The 10-year G-Sec?
Yes.
If I knew that I would not be in the corporate bond.
But you work with an assumption, right?
There are many moving parts. I get surprised when people give a view where it is going to be on 31st March or 30th April. The trend is upwards if you ask me because I I am much concerned about the macro headwinds.
North of 8%?
Again you cannot put a number but I think it should be over 8% over a period of time because there are significant headwinds -- one or two election surprises, one or two currency surprises on China can impact us very badly.

4 min read Last Updated : Oct 16 2022 | 10:41 PM IST
The merger between HDFC Bank and HDFC Ltd may be completed a few months or a quarter before the previously indicated deadline, said Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, chief financial officer, HDFC Bank.
“Maybe there is (scope of the merger being completed) a quarter or a few months early. We had previously indicated September -- call it a Q2-Q3 (FY24) kind of timeframe. The way it is going, it may be Q1-Q2. That’s the way that I would put it. Maybe there is a few months…it is running ahead,” he said at a post-earnings analyst call on Saturday.
HDFC Bank, the country’s largest private lender, detailed its earnings for July-September on Saturday. On Friday, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) gave its nod for holding a shareholders' meeting on November 25 for obtaining approval for the proposed merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank.
On April 4 this year, HDFC Bank said it would take over HDFC, the country’s largest mortgage lender, in a deal valued at $40 billion. The merger was initially to be completed by the second or third quarter of the next financial year.
Speaking about the requests for regulatory dispensations that had been made by HDFC Bank to the Reserve Bank of India, Vaidyanathan said the private lender continued to hold talks with the central bank. The bank had requested the RBI for permission to adopt a phased approach to comply with regulatory requirements, such as cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio, as well as norms on priority sector lending.
“I think we are going to do 142,000 villages. We were less than 100,000 villages if you go back 12-15 months ago. From here, we’ll be on track to go to 200,000 villages. We are on track to organically build this,” he said.
According to RBI norms, 40 per cent of banks’ adjusted net credit must be extended to the priority sector, which includes agriculture and micro, small and medium enterprises.
On a query about the slow pace of transmission of the RBI’s rate hikes to deposit rates, Vaidyanathan said HDFC Bank did not have any formula based on the repo rate or government security yields to set deposit rates. The bank has raised deposit rates by 50-60 bps in the 1-2-year category, against 190 bps of rate hikes by the RBI since May, analysts pointed out.
“We monitor that and see at which price point we need the money and thereby, the pricing is done in such a way. It is about demand, it is about the positioning in the market in terms of what price point we are looking to get,” he said.
Pointing out the bank has typically operated with a margin of 3.94-4.45 per cent, Vaidyanathan said the RBI’s policy tightening cycle could give a boost to its margin. In July-September, HDFC Bank’s core net interest margin was at 4.1 per cent on total assets, and 4.3 per cent based on interest-earning assets. He pointed out that over the past couple of years, the mix between retail and wholesale loans had switched.
“Retail is now at 45 per cent, wholesale is at 55 per cent. It’s switched, we are at the lower end of that range and now the rate cycle is going up. So you’re seeing some slight pick-up in the margin,” he said.
HDFC Bank reported a 20.1 per cent year-on-year increase in net profit to Rs 10,605.8 crore in July-September.
Vaidyanathan attributed HDFC Bank’ marked-to-market loss of Rs 253 crore in July-September to a sharp rise in short-term benchmark government bond yields, even as the yield on the 10-year benchmark paper fell 5 basis points during the quarter.
During July-September, the cut-off yield on one-year government treasury bills rose 51 basis points. Bond prices fall when yields rise.
The losses were mainly incurred on corporate bond investments and those on pass-through certificates, including priority sector loan certificates.
“These bonds and PTCs that we have are more on the front-end side. So, if you look at the dispersion of the bond book, it’s like a pretty good normal distribution around that 1.5-2-year type of range bucket,” he said.
“If you look at the rate, the base rate that determines the valuation of the bonds or PTCs...the base rate is the g-sec rate. The six-month rate is up 77 basis points in the quarter, one-year 67 basis points, two-year is 42 basis points and so on.",pass,credit

The Basics of Fixed Deposit Accounts
NewsVoir
Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], August 24: Fixed Deposits (FDs) have long been a preferred investment option among Indian investors, providing a straightforward way to grow wealth with predictable returns. Shriram Finance, a trusted name in the NBFC space, offers investors an opportunity to grow their savings over a specific period at a specified interest rate. Fixed Deposits are designed to cater to a wide range of investor needs and goals and it is important to know how FDs work, the various FD calculation methods, and how Shriram Finance FD can be a beneficial choice for your investment portfolio.
Introduction
In an ever-changing financial landscape, investors are constantly seeking safe and reliable investment avenues. Fixed Deposit (FD) accounts have long been a preferred choice for risk-averse investors looking to secure their savings and earn stable returns. As a time-tested financial instrument, Fixed Deposits offer a balance between security and profitability, making them an essential component of any well-rounded investment portfolio. In this guide, we will explore the basics of Fixed Deposit accounts, their benefits, and why they should be considered by both novice and seasoned investors.
What is a Fixed Deposit Account?
A Fixed Deposit account is a type of investment where you deposit a lump sum of money with a bank or financial institution for a predetermined period at a fixed interest rate. Unlike savings accounts, FDs do not allow premature withdrawal without a penalty, ensuring that your funds remain intact and grow steadily over the chosen tenure. At the end of the term, the investor receives the principal amount along with the accumulated interest.
Key Features of Fixed Deposit Accounts
1. Stable Returns: The primary attraction of Fixed Deposits is predictable returns. Once you lock in an interest rate, it remains unaffected by market fluctuations, providing a reliable and predictable income stream.
2. Flexible Tenure: FDs offer flexibility in terms of the investment period. Depending on your financial goals, you can choose a tenure ranging from days to months or years.
3. Interest Payout Options: Investors have the flexibility to choose how they receive their interest. Depending on the issuer, interest can be paid out monthly, quarterly, annually, or at maturity, allowing for customized cash flow management.
4. Cumulative and Non-Cumulative Schemes: Opt for cumulative FD to grow your investment until maturity or non-cumulative for regular payouts. While non-cumulative schemes pay out interest regularly (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly) offering steady income.
How Do Fixed Deposit Accounts Work?
Opening a Fixed Deposit account is a straightforward process. Here's how it works:
1. Choosing the Amount: The investor decides on the amount they wish to deposit. Most financial institutions have a minimum deposit requirement, which can vary depending on the institution and the type of FD.
2. Selecting the Tenure: The investor chooses the tenure for which they want to lock in their funds. FDs offer flexible tenures, typically ranging from 7 days to 10 years. The interest rate may vary depending on the chosen tenure, with longer tenures often offering higher rates.
3. Interest Payout Options: Investors can choose between cumulative and non-cumulative interest payout options. In a cumulative FD, interest is compounded and paid out at maturity, allowing for higher returns. In a non-cumulative FD, interest is paid out at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually), providing a steady income stream.
4. Maturity and Withdrawal: At the end of the FD tenure, the principal amount along with the accrued interest is returned to the investor. Investors can choose to reinvest the amount or withdraw it. Premature withdrawal is also possible, though it may incur a penalty.
Benefits of Investing in Fixed Deposit Accounts
1. Capital Preservation: For risk-averse investors, the security of the principal amount is paramount. FDs ensure that your capital is preserved, making them a safe investment option.
2. Stable Returns: With a fixed interest rate, FDs provide stable returns over the investment period. This makes them an attractive option for individuals seeking consistent income, particularly retirees.
3. No Market Risks: Unlike mutual funds or stocks, FDs are not subject to market volatility. The returns are fixed and do not depend on market performance, making FDs a low-risk investment.
4. Compounding Benefits: If you choose cumulative FDs, the interest earned is reinvested, resulting in the power of compounding. This can significantly boost your returns over time, especially for long-term investments.
5. Customizable Investments: Whether you want to invest for a short period or long term, FDs offer customizable options to suit your financial needs. You can also choose between monthly, quarterly, or annual interest payouts.
Who Should Invest in Fixed Deposit Accounts?
Fixed Deposits are ideal for conservative investors who prioritize safety over high returns. They are suitable for individuals with surplus funds who want to avoid market risks. Retirees looking for a stable income stream, parents saving for their children's education, or anyone planning for a significant financial goal will find FDs to be a reliable choice.
How to Open a Fixed Deposit Account?
Opening a Fixed Deposit account is a straightforward process. Most banks and financial institutions offer both online and offline application methods. Here's a simple step-by-step guide:
1. Choose the Financial Institution: Select a bank or financial institution that offers competitive FD rates. It's essential to compare interest rates across different banks to maximize your returns.
2. Determine the Investment Amount and Tenure: Decide on the amount you want to invest and the tenure. Consider your financial goals and liquidity needs when making this decision.
3. Complete the Application: Fill out the application form online or visit the branch to complete the process. You'll need to provide KYC documents such as a PAN card, Aadhaar card, and proof of address.
4. Deposit the Amount: Once your application is processed, deposit the chosen amount. You can do this through net banking, cheque, or demand draft.
5. Receive FD Certificate/Receipt: Upon successful deposit, you will receive an FD certificate or receipt, which serves as proof of your investment. This document contains details such as the principal amount, tenure, interest rate, and maturity date.
Fixed Deposit accounts remain one of the most trusted and reliable investment options in the financial market. Their guaranteed returns, low-risk profile, and flexibility make them an excellent choice for individuals seeking to preserve capital while earning a steady income. Whether you're a first-time investor or someone looking to diversify your portfolio, understanding the basics of Fixed Deposits can help you make informed decisions and achieve your financial goals.

Under the proposed scheme, the troubled or stressed assets of the non banking finance companies (NBFCs) will be bought by a government fund to revive the sector.
A high level review meeting was held on Monday, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A final decision will be taken on the matter.
The US government had initiated the TARP at the height of the Wall Street financial crisis of 2008.
The US Treasury Department created the TARP fund to stabilize the financial system and restore economic growth. TARP was rolled out to accomplish targets by purchasing troubled companies'' assets and stock.
September of 2008 saw a worldwide freeze as global credit markets came to a near standstill as several major financial institutions, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and American International Group (AIG), experienced severe financial stress and others, like Lehman Brothers went bankrupt due to the effects of the sub-prime mortgage crisis that had begun the previous year.

There have been calls by central bank intervention but RBI has refrained from specific company wise bailouts.

“Our borrowing costs have gone up to 50 basis points. We expect part of the higher cost to be shared by customers and dealers,” said Ramesh Iyer, vice-chairman and managing director, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. The average cost for a one-year borrowing for an NBFC rated “AAA” is around 8.8%., according to Bloomberg News.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Many NBFCs like Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd attribute the rise in borrowing cost to the recent change in mix of funding from mutual funds to banks.
“As the mutual fund outflows come to the banking system, borrowing costs for NBFCs have risen. Our incremental borrowing cost has gone up by 100 basis points,” said Umesh Revankar, managing director of Shriram Transport. “That said, we have enough liquidity for the growth of existing business. However, we require additional liquidity for a 20-25% growth, which is not available,” he said.
The liquidity crunch started after Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) defaulted on payments, prompting banks to freeze lending to NBFCs and housing finance companies. This caution worsened the liquidity situation of NBFCs. It got accentuated after DSP Mutual Fund sold a one-year ₹ 300-crore commercial paper issued by Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL) in the secondary market, at a discount of 11%. Further, a record ₹ 2.1 trillion flowed out of liquid and money market funds in September, shows data collated by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi).
In response to this liquidity crunch, SBI announced a liquidity support by announcing trebling of its portfolio purchase of loans from NBFCs to ₹ 45,000 crore this year.
The SBI move has met with mixed reaction from NBFCs. Some firms believe this will lead to NBFCs losing some of their best portfolio to banks and being left with bad assets. Other NBFC players feel there is need for stronger liquidity support from other banks.
“Recently, MFs faced huge redemptions in their liquid funds to the extent of around ₹ 2 trillion, and it is reported that the funds have moved to banks. This is a great opportunity for banks to use these funds to buy retail portfolios from NBFCs/HFCs to provide the much-needed liquidity at this point of time. Large and reputed NBFCs/HFCs will not have any ALM mismatch. However, they can use the portfolio sale proceeds to either pay off their CPs (commercial papers) or do further lending,” said R. Sridhar, executive vice chairman and chief executive of IndoStar Capital.
Analysts believe selling good assets could have a negative impact on the NBFCs’ business growth and profitability.
“We anticipate substantial slowdown in AUM growth of NBFC in 2HFY19 along with increase in cost of funds. This may result into broad-based cutting down of their existing growth and profitability guidance,” said Ashutosh Mishra, banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd.
Separately on 5 October, the Reserve Bank of India had warned of asset liability mismatches as NBFCs resort to increased market borrowings in the form of CPs for long-term funding such as infrastructure. The central bank assured that it will look at strengthening the ALM guidelines to avoid the roll-over risk going forward.",review_promoted,credit

Bajaj Housing Finance Limited
Pune (Maharashtra) [India], February 16 (ANI/NewsVoir): Bajaj Housing Finance Limited (BHFL), a subsidiary of Bajaj Finance Limited, has recently announced a revision in the approval time for home loans across the board. Customers can now receive a digital sanction letter for an e-home loan within just 10 minutes*.
This will help expedite the process of locking in on a property for aspiring homeowners. Borrowers can save time and complete the process over a shorter duration. With BHFL's high-value home loan of up to Rs 3.5 crore at rates starting 6.9 per cent p.a.*, and instant processing in 10 minutes*, borrowers can streamline the entire home-buying procedure. The digital sanction letter stands valid for 180 days.
The following are a few benefits of an instant housing loan digital sanction letter from Bajaj Housing Finance Limited.
Aspiring homeowners can cut short the burden of buying a property with the Bajaj Housing Finance home loan. Real estate projects are completed in multiple stages and often marketed accordingly, referred to as a soft launch. In some cases, developers provide early-bird discounts to individuals investing in those initial phases, and a sanction letter in 10 minutes* enables customers to cash in on the same.
Buying a house can be a time-consuming process but receiving the sanction for a home loan instantly allays a customer's stress significantly. When the worries of approval are out of the way, prospective homeowners can focus on the other details, like moving and packing, buying new furniture, and completing property-acquisition formalities, among others.
A digital sanction letter contains various details concerning the loan, including the total amount sanctioned, e-home loan interest rates, tenor, and associated terms and conditions.
Receiving the sanction letter for a BHFL housing loan in just 10 minutes* provides a customer more time to plan how to manage repayments.
Once the customer receives the sanction letter, he/she only needs to complete a few necessary formalities to conclude the process. Thus, applicants will find that an instant digital sanction letter simplifies the process of taking a loan since all the necessary documents are collected during the application of an e-home loan.
In that context, taking note of the eligibility criteria for a home loan with Bajaj Housing Finance Limited is necessary. Here is a list of documents that customers need to submit
* Scanned copies of Officially Valid Documents for KYC like Aadhaar card, PAN card, Voter's ID card, driving license, or passport
* Salary slips of the past few months or latest Form 16 (for salaried individuals)
* Latest savings account statements
* Business vintage proof of a minimum of 5 years (for self-employed individuals)
Bajaj Housing Finance Limited also extends pre-approved offers to customers alongside a quick digital sanction letter. Since these are pre-approved, an applicant only needs to submit property papers for fund disbursal. One can leverage their pre-approved offer on a housing loan to negotiate for better terms on their purchases.
Once individuals know the sum they are eligible to borrow, it can help them zero in on their search for a home. A pre-approved offer also provides an idea of the down payment a borrower needs to incur. With this offer in tow, availing of a home loan is now more streamlined than ever.
Bajaj Housing Finance Limited (BHFL) is a 100 per cent subsidiary of Bajaj Finance Limited - one of the most diversified NBFCs in the country with 19 product lines across consumer, commercial and SME finance catering to more than 38.6 million customers across the country. Headquartered in Pune, Bajaj Housing Finance Limited offers finance to individuals as well as corporate entities for purchase, construction and renovation of homes or commercial spaces. It also provides loan against property for business or personal needs as well as offers working capital for business expansion purposes. It also offers finance to builders and developers engaged in the construction of homes. The company enjoys highest long-term credit rating of AAA (Stable) by CRISIL and IND AAA (Stable) by India Ratings and highest short-term credit rating of CRISIL A1+ by CRISIL and IND A1+ by India Ratings.

Bench: Moushumi Bhattacharya
ODC-7 AP No. 318 of 2021 IN THE HIGH COURT AT CALCUTTA Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction ORIGINAL SIDE (COMMERCIAL DIVISION) SREI EQUIPMENT FINANCE LIMITED Versus GOUTAM SINGH & ANR. BEFORE: The Hon'ble JUSTICE MOUSHUMI BHATTACHARYA Date : August 18, 2021. (Via Video Conference) Appearance: Mr. Swatarup Banerjee, Adv. Ms. Akansha Chopra, Adv. ...Petitioner The Court: Affidavit-of-service filed in Court today be kept on record. The petitioner seeks appointment of a Receiver in respect of five assets for which loans were disbursed to the respondents in terms of a loan-cum-
hypothecation Agreement dated 15th March, 2018. The fact that the five assets were hypothecated to the petitioner in exchange of the loan would appear from the terms of the said Agreement. Under Schedule IV - The Events of Default - the Agreement provides that default by the Customer (the respondents in this case) in the payment of any of the instalments for repayment, or dishonour of any cheque shall constitute an event of default. The due date within which such repayment is to be made is clarified as 15th day of every month under Annexure-II to Schedule VII. 2 Article VII which provides for the remedies available to the petitioner would be clarified from Clause 7.2.1 thereunder which provides that in the event of default, the petitioner shall have the right to enter and remain in any place where the asset is located and take possession of the said asset. The Agreement contains jurisdiction clause which provides that Courts in Kolkata would have exclusive jurisdiction. The arbitration clause further provides that the arbitration shall be held at Kolkata.
According to learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, the respondents have not made repayments after the 22nd instalment which constrained the petitioner to terminate the Agreement on 17th June, 2021. The letter terminating the Agreement tabulates the total dues as approximately Rs.22.90 lakhs.
No one appears for the respondents despite service.
Upon perusing the relevant material on record, this Court is of the view that the petitioner has established a prima facie case for an interim order of protection by reason of the clauses in the Agreement governing the dispute between the parties. The balance of convenience is also in favour of an order being passed as prayed for since Clause 7.2.1 entitles the petitioner to certain specific remedies in the event of default. There are admitted defaults on the part of the respondents in the present case.
In view of the above, there shall be an order in terms of prayer (a) of the Notice of Motion. Ms. Hasi Saha, Advocate, Bar Association Room No. 12, is appointed as Receiver to take physical possession of the assets listed in prayer (a) of the petition. There shall also be an order of injunction restraining the respondents 3 from dealing with the assets which form the subject matter of the dispute till further orders are passed on this petition. The Receiver shall be entitled to a remuneration of Rs.70,000/- to be paid by the petitioner who shall also arrange for travel and accommodation and other incidental expenses of the Receiver since she has to travel to Odisha. The Advocate-on-Record of the petitioner is directed to serve a copy of this order on the respondents within 48 hours from date.

This will be applicable to these financial institutions in all states and union territories (UTs). This was issued as per the revised guidelines for lockdown 2.0 announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 14.
The move comes after NBFCs and MFIs repeatedly approached the government to be allowed to function like banks were. During Phase 1 of the lockdown, from the financial sector, only banks were allowed to function.
In a separate development, Reserve Bank of India's governor Shaktikanta Das announced a slew of measures to support the economy amid slowdown induced by the lockdown, COVID-19.
Nifty Financial Services was up over 5 percent at close on April 17 with M&M Financial Services, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Cholamandalam Investment surging over 10-17 percent each followed by Shriram Transport Finance, REC, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC, Bajaj Finance, and PFC.
RBI governor said, Targeted Long term repo operations (TLTRO) worth Rs 50,000 crore will be conducted to begin with, in tranches of appropriate sizes. ""Based on our assessment, the RBI will increase the size of the TLTRO. The funds availed by banks should be invested in investment-grade bonds companies and at least half of the funds should go to small NBFCs and MFIs,"" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said.
He also said that banks will maintain higher provision at standstill, which can be adjusted later for actual slippages. RBI has cut reverse repo rate by 25bps to 3.75 percent while the repo rate remains unchanged.
While the measures of the RBI meet most of the demands by NBFCs -the big ones and small and the medium sized ones as well-the stock price movement in the recent past have mostly discounted it. We may not see any big price appreciation in NBFCs from current levels, said Rajat Bose of rajatkbose.com.
The banking index was up over 6 percent after the reverse repo rate cut. ICICI Bank jumped 9 percent while HDFC Bank added over 3 percent. Axis Bank, RBL Bank, Federal Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, Bandhan Bank, and IDFC First Bank.

""Most Asia Pacific (APAC) banks have passed Moody's stress test on capital, except the banks in India, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam, because banks in these jurisdictions have lower starting capital ratios and higher starting problem loan ratios,"" the rating company said.
Moody's Investors Service's outlook for the banking industry in Asia Pacific is negative over the next 12 months, because owing to the US-China trade dispute, which will weaken economic and trade activity in the region, and erode investor confidence.
""Weaker economic and trade conditions will lead to moderate increases in problem loans for APAC banks,"" said Eugene Tarzimanov, Moody's Vice President and Senior Credit Officer.
""Meanwhile, the banks' profitability will fall, because they are raising credit provisions while central banks are cutting interest rates to support economic growth,"" said Tarzimanov.
Nevertheless, Moody's said that APAC banks have generally maintained good capital and liquidity buffers and the probability of government support for these banks will stay high, except for the banks in Hong Kong, because the territory is the only jurisdiction in APAC with an operational resolution regime.
With recurring NBFC fiascos such as the IL&FS and the recent case of DHFL, the government has asked the Reserve Bank of India to consider several proposals to de-stress the NBFC sector, including the creation of a special fund by the central bank to buy out stressed assets of the top NBFCs.
Sources said the discussions are going on, although the central bank is not very keen on moving forward. The fund being mulled is in line with the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Programme (TARP) of the US, under which the government purchased toxic assets and equity from financial institutions to strengthen its financial sector.

They will hold asset liability committee meetings in January to decide new rates. LIC Housing Finance took the lead in cutting rates just a few days ago.
The likes of HDFC, PNB Housing Finance, and Indiabulls Housing have begun examining the commercial viability of reducing rates, said people familiar with the matter.
“Competitive pressure will ensure that housing finance companies also cut rates,” said Karthik Srinivasan, senior vice president at ICRA Ratings. “The quantum will depend on their cost of borrowings as barring select HFCs, access to cheap funds remains a challenge for many. They would not have a liquidity glut like banks, which accesses cheap money via public deposits.”
Home financiers have been facing liquidity challenges since the IL&FS defaults in September 2018.
company’s asset liability committee will meet this month to review rate decisions.
“We will be considering a rate cut in our next asset liability committee meeting in the first week of January,” said Gagan Banga, MD, Indiabulls Housing Finance. “We expect demand to pick up in the first quarter of the calendar year 2020.”
In the fourth quarter of FY20, lenders expect a pick-up in credit growth. Small value loans, which are helping fund affordable homes, might see reduced rates.
“Housing finance companies are likely to cut about 25 basis points in the next few weeks following the SBI move,” said Vipul Patel, founder MortgageWorld, a Mumbai-based advisory firm. “But expected rate reductions would be subject to ceilings where low value loans would be prioritised.”
SBI Monday announced a reduction in its external benchmark-based rate by 25 bps to 7.80 per cent from 8.05 per cent per annum. The revision comes into effect from Wednesday.

Shares of major NBFCs Bajaj Finance, M&M Financial, and Five Star Business Finance have declined up to 15 percent this year, while Shriram Finance and LIC Housing Finance have gained up to 14 percent.
Though valuations have come down in the past month, several NBFC stocks trade at 5-44 percent premium compared to their historical price-to-book (P/B) averages.

SBI Card, M&M Financial to be worst hit
The analysts said they remain negative on SBI Card due to its 100 percent unsecured book and M&M Financial Services due to its subdued return on equity (RoE) profile of 9-10 percent over the past 10 years. They have a ""reduce"" call on both stocks.
The overall growth of NBFCs is likely to moderate on account of multiple headwinds. On top is the regulatory action taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on unsecured loans by increasing risk-weight on them, which would eventually slow down their loan growth in the medium term.
In other unsecured loans, consumer durable or credit cards, NBFCs are losing market share to banks due to elevated competitive intensity, Nomura said.
""Even in secured segments like auto or home, NBFCs are losing market share to banks due to elevated competitive intensity,"" the note said.

Cost of funds to remain elevated in FY25
Analysts expect cost of funds to remain elevated for most part of FY25 due to potential increase in rates at which banks lend to NBFCs due to increased risk weight. Potential rise in corporate/NBFCs yields, lower probability of a repo rate cut in H1FY25F, lower growth in unsecured loans and elevated competition in secured segments would add to the probelm.
""Assuming a rate cut will take place by the end of FY25, SBI Cards would be the one with the maximum positive impact, and LIC Housing Finance the lowest in FY26F. Within other NBFCs, Bajaj Finance and Cholamandalam Finance would be the least positively impacted due to rate cuts,"" the brokerage firm highlighted.

It is clarified that Sebi has not issued any such advisory,” the regulator said in a statement.
The clarification follows Sebi seeking details from mutual funds about their exposure to all NBFCs and housing finance companies, amid concerns over liquidity in the system, according to sources.
In recent days, shares of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies have taken a beating against the backdrop of IL&FS group entity defaulting on its debt obligations, triggering fears of liquidity crunch.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has sent letters to mutual funds seeking details about their exposure to all NBFCs and housing finance companies, regulatory and industry sources said.
The companies include DHFL and Indiabulls Housing Finance, they added.
Mutual funds have significant exposure to several housing finance firms and NBFCs as a whole, including through their debt securities.
On Thursday, shares of NBFCs and housing finance companies tumbled up to 8.5 per cent on worries over liquidity.

On Thursday, the Reserve Bank allowed banks to dip further into statutory liquidity cash reserves in a bid to ease a liquidity squeeze afflicting the nation’s money markets.
The move by the central bank follows concerns over tight liquidity conditions and banks’ unwillingness to lend to NBFCs.

Investor lent Rs 3,000 crore to property developers last year

5 min read Last Updated : Feb 07 2023 | 5:39 PM IST
PAG — an alternative investment firm focused on Asia-Pacific (APAC) — has taken a liking to Indian real estate, entering into multiple debt deals with property developers in the country. This comes at a time when most domestic non-banking companies (NBFCs) are going slow on lending to property developers.
PAG loaned about Rs 3,000 crore last year, said a senior real estate executive, adding it had become one of the single largest lenders to developers in 2022.
PAG granted about Rs 8,000 crore in recent years prior to 2022 when most lenders, such as Edelweiss, Indiabulls and Piramal, were dawdling on lending to real estate developers in the aftermath of the NBFC liquidity crunch activated by the Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services’ financial collapse.
Kanak Kapur, partner and managing director, credit and markets, PAG, said, “We have funded several transactions in India in 2022, and cannot comment on individual investment. Each transaction is undertaken based on its strength, not based on the relative value of transactions versus other market participants. It will not be right to compare these with any other participant. We are focused on making high-quality investments and assessing opportunities on an individual basis.”
Last month, it collaborated with Shapoorji Pallonji Real Estate (SPRE), Indiabulls Housing Finance, and Lokhandwala Kataria Construction for reviving the Minerva Towers luxury project in South Mumbai.
It also gave Rs 750 crore to SPRE in 2020.
Last year, it advanced Rs 900 crore to Elan Group for acquisition and growth.
PAG is one of the biggest investors in Asia. As of June 30, 2022, it managed $50 billion in assets for nearly 300 institutional fund investors from around the world. It has mainly three divisions: private equity (PE), credit and markets, and real assets.
“It has done deals that cannot be done through normal banking channels like lending for buying land or taking over a stressed asset,” said an investment banking executive.
Aggressive lending
About half of PAG’s $2.6-billion debt fund it raised in December last year is expected to come to Indian real estate, said the banking executive quoted earlier. The fund is touted to be the biggest debt fund raised in APAC so far.
To this, Kapur said: “We don’t comment on our country allocations by the fund. However, we do believe India’s real estate sector currently presents us with good risk/reward, and we will continue to focus on and invest in this market.”
The executive quoted earlier said PAG has also lowered its rates in recent deals.
“It used to charge 22-23 per cent before March 2022. Today, it charges 19-20 per cent when other lenders have increased rates. It is not losing deals for higher rates,” he said.
Said Kapur: “We don’t comment on rates. Each transaction is priced based on individual risk profile and underlying collateral package.”
According to sources, PAG wants to double its investment this year in Indian real estate.
However, Kapur said it neither has any specific target exposure for India nor investments done to achieve any targets.
“We invest in the sector as long as the risk/reward meets our requirements. We have considerable dry powder in our funds to invest in any Asian market which presents good risk/reward metrics,” he said.
While Indian NBFCs have reduced their exposure to real estate in the past few years, funds, such as PAG, Oaktree, Värde Partners, Inc. and others, have become active in lending to Indian developers, said experts.
“It (PAG) started slow and gathered pace when the right transactions came their way,” said Vishal Srivastava, executive director, Anarock Capital.
Any global fund active in India today operates at an internal rate of return of over 19 per cent since they have to show dollar return to their investors,” said Srivastava.
One of the main reasons for funds like PAG, Oaktree, Värde, and Apollo is the lack of adequate capital deployment by NBFCs, which have still not recovered from the after-effects of the ILFS-triggered crisis in the segment, he added.
Another capital markets head of an international property consultancy firm said the absence of attractive opportunities in global markets is making international investors look at India actively.
“In Europe, China, and the rest of the world, there are few borrowers, and lending rates are in single digits. In India, they get high double-digit returns,” he said.
The head of a Singapore-based investor said PAG does “clean deals” and does not get into slum redevelopment, or inventory-based lending.
“Global investors mostly do English mortgage deals,” he said.
However, PAG cannot do smaller sized deals, he said, adding, “It is a small set-up in India that likes to do a limited number of deals of large sizes. Deals are mostly structured as debt as they can take charge of assets. They are PE deals,” he added.

The exposure of mutual funds into the various debt instruments of the NBFC sector has declined while the exposure of corporate debt paper saw a notable increase in October.
According to a report by CARE Ratings, exposure of mutual funds to non-banking financial company (NBFC) stood at Rs 1.83 lakh crore in November 2019, a drop of Rs 81,867 crore since July 2018, when the NBFC crisis surfaced.
While the amount has reduced, the percentage share also declined from 19 percent in July 2018 to 12.3 percent in November 2019.
Typically, the financial services sector, including NBFCs and housing finance companies (HFCs), has been the largest borrowers from mutual funds.
A slew of credit default cases, including at IL&FS and DHFL, has led to MFs suffering huge losses.
The report revealed that investments in CPs (Commercial papers) of NBFCs are on a consistent decline every month.
After the liquidity crisis triggered in the NBFC space, MFs withdrew 45 percent of their investments from this category.
Mutual funds attributed the fall in NBFC exposure to ongoing liquidity crisis in the space and also to the reduction in sectoral exposure limits by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in NBFC forcing MFs to pare their investments.
SEBI directed mutual funds to reduce exposure to NBFCs from 25 percent to 20 percent.
In November, the largest proportion of funds of debt AUMs were invested in corporate debt paper
The fund houses invested worth Rs 4.07 lakh crore in the corporate debt segment which includes floating rate bonds, non-convertible debentures, among others.
Compared with October, assets in this category improved by Rs 6,711 crore. However, in percentage terms, it declined marginally to 27.3 percent of debt AUMs.
Currently, the debt AUM of the mutual fund industry stands at Rs 13.53 lakh crore.
The second highest category in which debt AUMs invested their money was Commercial Papers (CPs) with investments of Rs 3.37 lakh crore.
CPs are short term money market instruments issued by large corporate to borrow for up to a year. Maturities on commercial paper rarely range longer than 270 days. Money raised via CPs are typically used for the financing of accounts payable and inventories and meeting short-term liabilities.
Currently, 42 mutual funds manage Rs 27.05 lakh crore of assets under management (AUM).

(IBH) announced its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended September 30th 2022.
Highlights:
- PAT for Q2FY23 is Rs. 289 Cr, vs Q2FY22 PAT of Rs. 286 Cr.
- PAT for H1FY23 is Rs. 576 Cr, vs H1FY22 PAT of Rs. 568 Cr.
- Balance sheet, loan book and AUM have stabilized. Base formed for ~10% AUM growth in FY23
- Retail disbursals under the asset-light model have increased 9x times in H1FY23 v/s H1FY22
- Since FY2022, retail disbursals of ~Rs. 7,800 Cr have been done under the asset-light model. Disbursals have sharply picked up, retail AUM has resumed growth and asset-light model is earning RoA of 3%+
- Over 1,500 employees added since March 2021
- Book spread has expanded to 3.1% at end H1FY23 as rate increases have been passed on
- Assignment / Securitization / Co-lending constituted 31% of IBH's funding mix as at end of Q2FY23
- In H1FY23, Stage 2 loans assets are down by 26% from FY22, and 39% from FY21
- Gross NPAs at 2.94% in Q2FY23. Net NPAs at 1.70%. Total provisions at Rs. 1,775 Cr [3.0% of loan book], which is 2.6x times of the regulatory requirement. Stage 3 provision coverage ratio at 42%
- Capital adequacy stands at 34% and Tier 1 at 28%.
- Net gearing at 2.5x at the end of Q2FY23. Will remain stable at these levels as incremental business will be done in an asset-light model
- The Company's Liquidity Coverage Ratio stood at 196% against a regulatory requirement of only 50%.
- Board has approved creation of ear-marked pool of fixed deposits in four tranches from Q3FY23 to meet ECB repayments due in Q2FY24. The board has also approved subsequently creating similar ear-marked pools to meet FCCB dues due in Q4FY24
- Opened 11 new branches in H1FY23
- Of the 7 partner banks and FIs, IBH has completed technical integration with 4. Tech integration with all 7 will be completed within FY23 itself
Scaling up of Disbursals under Retail Asset-Light Model
The Company disbursed retail loans of Rs. 4,598 Cr under the asset-light model in H1FY23, scaling up from its quarterly disbursal run-rate of Rs. 1,500 Cr in H2FY22. The Company has completed co-lending tech integration with 4 partners and expect to complete the tech integration with the remaining 3 partners within FY23 itself.
In-line with its guidance, the AUM of the Company is now on the growth trajectory. Under the asset- light model, the AUM will keep compounding while balance-sheet size and on-balance sheet loan book will stay flat or decline sometimes.
Much like in the US where the sell down / securitization market is increasingly getting streamlined, The Company is working towards a multi-bank marketplace where loans seamlessly flow to multiple partner banks. The Company has standardized its documentation across all its partners, and the loan appraisal and on-boarding processes have also been standardized. Along with tech integration, the Company has also put in place a straight pass through mechanism, such that loans approved under the joint policy get seamlessly on-boarded with partner banks.
In fact, with a large public sector bank, the Company successfully completed an end-to-end digital straight-pass-through pilot. Incremental disbursals are now being on-boarded through this straight-pass-through digital platform
Increase in Reference Rate and Expansion of Spreads
Book spread has expanded to 3.1% at end H1FY23 as rate increases have been passed on.
An increasing interest rate cycle is always beneficial for the Company's spreads, as over 99% of its advances are on floating rate, wherein the Company passes on the rate increase almost instantaneously, while a large part of its funding mix is on a fixed rate basis. The rate increases will thus help improve the Company's spreads and NIMs going ahead.

Of the numbers declared so far, most lenders posted growth in advances or AUM (assets under management) of over 14 per cent with sector leaders HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance seeing growth of 16 per cent and 32 per cent y-o-y, respectively. Other major lenders such as M&M Financial Services, IndusInd Bank, IDFC First Bank, RBL Bank, and Federal Bank saw loan growth of 20-28 per cent, similar to last quarter.
While Q1 is typically a slower quarter for lenders, most of these players also reported 4-6 per cent growth in advances sequentially.
Sustained credit growth, especially by retail-oriented lenders, reflects that domestic consumption and the demand for credit remains strong, despite rising interest rates and elevated inflation.
YES Bank and Bandhan Bank continued to underperform the sector, posting credit growth of below 15 per cent, in the range of 6-8 per cent y-o-y. Both the lenders have been running down their microfinance and corporate exposures, respectively, leading to overall muted growth. Bandhan Bank’s advances fell 5.5 per cent on quarter.
Deposit accretion too maintained its momentum and most major lenders reported deposit growth of over 13 per cent y-o-y, barring RBL Bank, South Indian Bank, and Dhanlaxmi Bank. Sequential trends too showed steady deposit growth, albeit RBL Bank, YES Bank, Bandhan Bank, and Dhanlaxmi Bank likely slowed down deposit mobilisation due to muted loan growth. CSB Bank’s deposits were 0.1 per cent lower sequentially.
HDFC Bank saw muted q-o-q growth in both advances and deposits, as the bank is expected to have minimised balance sheet growth ahead of the merger of HDFC with itself effective July 1. The lender’s advances were up 0.9 per cent and deposits 1.6 per cent.
Banks such as HDFC Bank, IDFC First Bank, Federal Bank, YES Bank, and Bandhan Bank saw their deposits growing faster than advances on a y-o-y basis. Bajaj Finance’s fixed deposits also surged by 46 per cent, albeit on a much smaller base.

There can also be an adverse impact on the outstanding housing credit, which stood at Rs 19.1 lakh crore as of March 2019, ratings agency Icra said in a weekend report. It can be noted that the government is betting on the housing sector as one of the major vehicles to push the sagging economic growth. Given the tough operating environment, we expect housing credit growth in FY20 to be in the range of 13-15 percent which is lower than the last three years when it clipped past 17 percent, it said in a note. The overall industry loan growth for housing finance companies had slowed down to 15 percent for FY18. [caption id=“attachment_4306961” align=“alignleft” width=“380”] Representational image. Reuters.[/caption] It said the issues with the non-banking lenders since last September that has seen a slew of companies like DHFL and Reliance Capital suffering, slowed down credit growth of dedicated housing finance companies to 10 percent in FY19. Banks grew faster at 19 percent as against 13 percent, taking their overall market share to 64 percent from 62 in the year-ago period, it said, adding banks will lead the growth curve in FY20 as well. However, given the under-penetration of mortgages, the agency expects growth to recover soon. The gross non-performing assets ratio from the overall housing finance exposures increased to 1.5 in March 2019, from 1.1 a year ago. There could be some pressure on the asset quality owing to the challenging operating environment and the emerging risk factors, it warned. The overall NPAs of HFCs will grow to up to 1.8 percent due to troubles faced by some developers, it said. Unlike most previous financial years, when NPAs decline in the last quarter through enhanced recovery efforts, gross NPAs increased to 1.5 percent as on March 2019 (against 1.4 percent in December 2018) from 1.1 percentas of March 2018. Some reduction in NPAs was seen in the affordable new housing segment, to 4.6 percent as of March 2019 from 5 percent as of December 2018, it said, attributing the same to write-offs and sale of NPAs by some of the players.

Both L&T Finance and Edelweiss Group refuted the allegations by the Reliance Group.
A few Non-Banking Finance Companies, ""substantially L&T Finance and certain entities of Edelweiss Group, have invoked pledge of listed shares of Reliance Group and made open market sales of the value of approximately Rs 400 crore from February 4 to 7,” the group said in a statement.
It was not clear who had pledged the shares.
“The illegal, motivated and wholly unjustified action by the above two groups has precipitated a fall of Rs 13,000 crore, an unprecedented nearly 55 per cent, in market capitalisation of Reliance Group over just these four short days,” it noted.
In that period, shares of Reliance Power plunged 62.1 per cent, while those of Reliance Infrastructure dropped 58.6 per cent, and Reliance Capital fell 38.6 per cent.
The Reliance Group said the actions have caused substantial losses to 72 lakh institutional and retail shareholders, and harming the interests of all stakeholders.
Citing legal advice, the group also said the purported exercise of rights to enforce the security is illegal and excessive, and against the process and requirements of the respective borrowings' documentation.
""The manner of conduct of the above open market sales... is also illegal on several counts, including amongst others, price manipulation, insider trading, front running and market abuse, and is in violation of various regulatory provisions...,"" said the statement issued during market hours.
Further, the group said that Reliance Capital, Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Power as well as their various subsidiaries are performing satisfactorily on all operating parameters, and there is no change whatsoever on any aspect as compared to the position prevailing prior to these sales.
Refuting the allegations, L&T Finance said it had granted loans against pledge of shares to Reliance ADAG Group companies.
""As per loan and pledge agreements, borrower did not cure various events of defaults including providing margin for shortfall in the stipulated security cover. ""Despite various notices in the past few months, events of defaults continued. Consequently, L&T Finance enforced its rights of invocation and sold pledged shares to the extent of its outstanding dues by following the due process of contract and law,"" it said in a statement.
While noting that the allegations as ""unfounded, baseless and false"", Edelweiss Group said it had granted credit facilities against pledge of shares to Reliance ADAG Group.
Edelweiss Group said it has reached out numerous times to Reliance ADAG Group to address concerns on shortfall in margins and resultant fall in collateral valuation.
""Despite our best efforts, not only did Reliance ADAG Group fail to address any of the concerns raised by Edelweiss Group, but also continued to breach contractual obligations,"" it said in a separate statement.
On February 4, there was a sharp drop in the prices of Reliance ADAG group shares, which led to further erosion in the collateral value, Edelweiss said, adding that it also gave due opportunity for remediation. “Since there was no response from Reliance ADAG Group, it necessitated liquidation of the collateral as per the agreed contractual terms. Throughout this process, Edelweiss has acted in a lawful and responsible manner,” it added.
The group also said that plans by RCom to resolve its debt through the National Company Law Tribunal had no adverse impact on the three companies in question.

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], June 7 (ANI): Equity benchmark indices oscillated between gains and losses on Friday, a day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) marginally reduced key interest rates and serious funding challenges appeared to cripple non-bank financial institutions.
However, the BSE SP Sensex closed 86 points higher at 39,616 while the Nifty 50 gained 27 points to 11,871. The rally was largely by IT and financial stocks.
At the National Stock Exchange, sectoral indices of bank, financial service, IT and private bank were in the green. But Nifty pharma was down 1.2 per cent. Auto, FMCG, metal, PSU bank and realty also closed in the red.
Among the prominent gainers were IndusInd Bank, State Bank of India, Bajaj Finance, Bharti Infratel, and Bharat Petroleum Corporation.
But shares of Eros International Media fell further by 14.4 per cent, a day after tumbling nearly 20 per cent after CARE rating agency cut its creditworthiness citing delays or likely defaults in serving debt availed from banks.
Home loan lender Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) too slid further by over 11 per cent despite reassuring comments from its management pertaining to payment of interest obligations.
On Thursday, it dropped 15.86 per cent after rating agencies ICRA and Crisil slashed their outlook on the company's commercial paper programme. Fitch Ratings said DHFL's liquidity problems highlight the funding challenges faced by non-bank finance sector.
Among other losers were Dr Reddy, Yes Bank, Cipla, Powergrid and JSW Steel.
Many investors believe the RBI's move to cut interest rates marginally is unlikely to stimulate demand in the near-term due to the absence of quick resonance in financial market.
Besides, the central bank did not give any clear stance as far as non-banking financial companies are concerned.

Global cues are likely to dominate investor sentiment on Friday. US equities hit a fresh record high on Thursday, boosted by gains in industrial companies on continued relief that fresh US and China tariffs were less damaging than feared. Asian stocks, too, rose in the early trade.
Here's a list of top stocks that may remain on investors' radar in today's session -
YES Bank: The stock is likely to remain in focus today as the RBI has curtailed the term of Yes Bank's founding CEO Rana Kapoor and asked the private sector lender to look for his replacement by January 2019. Brokerages such as IDFC Securities and Citi have downgraded the stock while Macquarie have maintained 'Outperform' rating.
Hotel Leelaventure: The cash-strapped company on Thursday said it had defaulted on payment of quarterly interest of Rs 21.2 million to LIC. Hotel Leelaventure, which currently has a debt of over Rs 36.62 billion, had issued secured redeemable NCDs on private placement basis, aggregating Rs 900 million to LIC in December 2008.
Aditya Birla Retail: Aditya Birla Group has signed a deal to sell Aditya Birla Retail (ABRL) to home-grown private equity fund Samara Capital and global e-commerce giant Amazon. The Group did not disclose the value of the deal, but sources said it was around Rs 42 billion.

Tata Motors: Fitch Ratings has revised the outlook on Tata Motors to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’ on expectations that higher capital spending at Jaguar Land Rover will result in negative free cash flow in the current and the next financial year.
Jet Airways: Several passengers on a Jet Airways flight from Mumbai to Jaipur suffered nose and ear bleeding Thursday after the crew ""forgot"" to turn on a switch that controls cabin air pressure. ""During climb, the crew forgot to select bleed switch due to which cabin pressurisation could not be maintained. As a result, oxygen masks got deployed,"" the official at aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), said.
ITC: NDMC, the capital's civic body, looks set to take the auction of Delhi's iconic luxury hotel Taj Mahal next Friday after it received the minimum two bids for the asset. Besides Indian Hotels Company (IHCL), the current operator of the hotel, rival ITC has also submitted bids for the 292-room hotel.
HCL Tech: The company has won IT deal from UK's third largest retailer Asda. The three-year application services contract will involve Asda’s IT Application Services being transformed with a new DevOps delivery model to drive data and analytics and support back-office applications.

Under the current circumstances, any Indian company with a fair share of builder loans has to walk the extra mile to raise overseas credit.
MUMBAI: Piramal Capital and Housing Finance is looking to raise as much as $400 million through external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and ease liquidity pressure as domestic lenders are hesitant to lend to the sector, said two bankers familiar with the matter. The company is in talks with a group of bankers that is helping to syndicate the offshore loan, said one of the people cited above.
The pricing of the two-to-five-year loan is yet to be finalised. Typically, such debt has a markup or spread of 200-300 basis points over the dollar-linked London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), dealers said, citing past deals. However, global investors have turned risk averse with many countries yielding less than zero for their benchmark bonds, said an investment banker.
“Under the current circumstances, any Indian company with a fair share of builder loans has to walk the extra mile to raise overseas credit,” the person said.
Piramal Capital didn’t respond to queries.
The company is struggling due to the current cash crunch in the real estate sector because of its heavy builder loans. It recently sold off a 10% stake in Shriram Transport Finance for Rs 2,300 crore.
Funding Costs at Multi-year Highs
There’s speculation that Ajay Piramal may also exit his investments of 20% in Shriram Capital and 10% in Shriram City Union. Piramal Capital has a wholesale book of Rs 51,436 crore, out of which real estate loans account for Rs 40,160 crore.
Apart from IL&FS, repayment worries over Dewan Housing Finance and the Essel Group have pushed funding costs at NBFCs to multi-year highs. Spreads on top-rated five-year bonds of Indian nonbanking lenders rose 90 basis points, or 0.9 percentage points, in the past year but have dipped lately. The average funding costs for shadow banks surged as much as 170 basis points between September and April this year. They came off marginally later amid a softer interest rate regime. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.

Market participants widely expect the Fed to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by 75 basis points (bps) to a range of 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent, the fourth such hike in a row.
Asian stocks mostly moved higher despite an overnight decline on Wall Street. South Korea's KOSPI edged 0.07 per cent higher, the Shanghai Composite index climbed 1.15 per cent and Hang Seng Index surged 2.41 per cent, while Japan's Nikkei index shed 0.05 per cent.
US stock futures climbed, indicating a higher opening for Wall Street today. S&P futures rose 0.11 per cent, Nasdaq futures moved 0.27 per cent higher and Dow Futures edged 0.01 per cent up.
On the domestic front, the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) Monetary Policy Committee is also on the cards, scheduled for November 3 (Thursday). The policy-setting committee would potentially discuss its response to the government on its failure to stick to its inflation target for three straight quarters.
Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors bought a net Rs 2,610 crore worth of equities on Tuesday, while domestic investors sold Rs 730 crore of shares, as per provisional data available with the National Stock Exchange.
Here are the share market highlights:
""The Bank Nifty index continued sideways consolidation between the 41,000-41,500 range. The options data suggest stiff resistance on the upside at 41,500 where the highest open interest is built up on the call side.

""With the FOMC's (Federal Open Market Committee's) outcome around the corner, profit-booking and a risk-off mood dragged the domestic market to trade with cuts. Meanwhile, strong US employment figures dented expectations for a slowdown in rate hikes. Since the market has already priced in a 75 bps rate hike by the Fed, market movement will be determined by their comments on its next moves,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.
The overall market breadth stood weak as 1,801 shares advanced while 1,670 declined on BSE. The market capitalization (m-cap) of BSE-listed companies fell to Rs 281.57 lakh crore.

According to sources, State Bank of India (SBI) has signed the transaction document on September 20 while other lenders are likely to do so in coming days.
This could also give a boost to second-quarter earnings of the lenders to DHFL, who had written off the loans. The housing finance company has admitted claims of about ₹88,000 crore and banks will have a recovery of about 40 per cent of their loans.
According to the approved resolution plan, Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Ltd will pay ₹37,250 crore for the mortgage financier. Financial creditors are also likely to sign the transaction document and will be repaid soon.
However, fixed deposit holders and others small investors of DHFL are hoping for a favourable verdict from the National Company Appellate Law Tribunal (NCLAT). The NCLAT is scheduled to take up appeals on the NCLT approval to DHFL’s resolution plan on September 29.
“We will wait for the NCLAT to decide on our appeal challenging the NCLT approval. We are prepared to approach the Supreme Court also,” said Vinay Kumar Mittal, a lead petitioner in the court on behalf of FD holders of DHFL.

Divergence refers to the difference between the RBI's inspection report and the lender’s own report.

The current low interest rates on bank fixed deposits add to the appeal of these NCDs (or bonds) - both in the new issues as well as those trading in the secondary market.
If you are looking to invest in NCDs to better your debt returns, here are a few points to note.
Return metrics
The fixed coupon or interest rate, calculated on the face value of the bond is what an investor receives periodically (say, quarterly, half-yearly or annually) in the form of interest income. This is the ‘return’ most investors usually focus on. If you invest in an NCD in the primary issue and stay invested until maturity, then the periodic coupon or interest indicates your investment return.
Alternatively, if you buy an NCD in the secondary market and stay invested until maturity, then you must focus on the YTM (yield to maturity) rather than the coupon rate as the correct indicator of your return. The YTM takes into account not just the periodic coupons but also the price at which the bond is bought and redeemed to arrive at the total return. Let’s take an example. Secondary market data from HDFC Securities shows that AAA-rated Tata Capital Financial Services bonds (series - 890TCFSL23 - Individual) priced at ₹1,123 per bond, with a residual maturity of 2.07 years offer a coupon of 8.90 per cent and YTM of 6.79 per cent. A YTM lower than the coupon implies that a bond is trading at a premium. That is, the current market price of the bond is greater than its face value. The latter is what will be paid to you on maturity. In the prevailing low interest rate environment, an 8.9 per cent coupon bond commanding premium pricing is hardly surprising.
Then, there are NCDs that come with a call or put option. Callable bonds give the issuer the right to call back the bond before its maturity by paying back the principal. Putable bonds give the investor an option to exit before maturity and receive the principal. In case of NCDs with a call option, the appropriate return metric to look at is YTC (yield to call) and not YTM. The YTC is the return that an investor gets if the bond is held until the call date. Only very few retail NCDs come with such an option.
Exit or not
While NCDs get listed on the stock exchanges and provide the possibility of an exit option, not many can be bought and sold as easily as shares. This is due to the lack of adequate trading volumes for many NCDs in the retail segment. In such a case, one must be prepared to stay invested until maturity.
Once an NCD lists on the exchanges, it may trade at a price different from its issue price. Over time, the value of the bond will fluctuate in response to factors such as interest rate changes and ratings upgrades or downgrades. So, if you sell a bond before maturity, your final investment return will be impacted by the difference between the selling price versus the purchase price of the bond. This could result in a capital gain or loss for you. Today, with interest rates expected to rise, albeit not immediately, the existing lower-coupon bonds carry the risk of depreciating in value over time resulting in a possible capital loss when sold.
Taxation
The coupon or interest received from NCDs is taxed at your income tax slab rate. Short-term capital gains are taxed at your slab rate. Long-term capital gains in case of listed and unlisted NCDs are taxed at 10 per cent and 20 per cent (both without indexation) respectively. Capital gains on sale of NCDs that have been held for more than a year in case of listed NCDs and more than three years in case of unlisted ones are treated as long-term in nature.
NCDs in the retail segment quote at their dirty price. That is, the quoted market price is inclusive of the accrued interest on them.
According to Nimish Shah, CIO, Waterfield Advisors, when an NCD is sold, the differential between the sale price and the purchase price is segregated into two parts – capital gains and accrued interest – for taxation purposes. Let’s say, you buy a bond with a coupon of 8 per cent per annum (paid semi-annually) at a face value of ₹100 in January. Suppose this bond is trading at price of ₹110 on March 31. Since the first coupon payment is due in June, the accrued interest by March-end is ₹2. The difference between the sale and purchase price of the bond of ₹10 will be split into two parts – ₹2 accrued interest and ₹8 capital gains and taxed as such – when the bond is sold in March.

In a scathing piece, former governor Raghuram Rajan and former RBI deputy governor Viral Acharya described the RBI working group’s most important recommendation—letting businesses own banks—as a ‘bombshell’.
Last week, an Internal Working Group (IWG), set up by the RBI, recommended changes in private bank ownership guidelines and entry norms for corporates.
Part of the proposals was that large NBFCs could convert to banks and large businesses can be considered for setting up banks. To be sure, these are recommendations, not guidelines. The RBI will take final guidelines based on this report.
Timing questioned
But Rajan and Acharya said, while the proposals are tempered with many caveats, these raise an important question. “Why now? Have we learnt something that allows us to override all the prior cautions on allowing industrial houses into banking?” the authors asked.
In the past, the RBI has been largely hesitant to let large businesses promote banks.
Rajan and Acharya question the urgency and timing of the Working Group proposals. “After all, committees are rarely set up out of the blue. Is there some dramatic change in perception that it is responding to?” the authors asked.
In the appendix, the IWG report states that all experts it consulted barring one has opposed the idea of corporate entry into banking. “Yet, it recommends change,” the authors noted.
The IWG proposals have come with certain riders. According to the IWG recommendations, large corporate/industrial houses may be allowed as promoters of banks only after necessary amendments to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
This is aimed at preventing connected lending and exposures between the banks and other financial and non-financial group entities and strengthening of the supervisory mechanism for large conglomerates, including consolidated supervision.
However, Rajan and Acharya aren’t very confident that these changes will be enough to guard the banking sector. “If sound regulation and supervision were only a matter of legislation, India would not have an NPA problem,” Rajan and Acharya said.
The authors have lauded 'many of the technical rationalizations' proposed by the working group but its main recommendation –letting corporates in banking—“is best left on the shelf,” they said.
Explaining the risks in corporates running banks, Rajan said, corporate houses can use the banks floated to get fund when they need. Also, the regulators can succumb to political pressure or the urgency of the moment.
“The history of such connected lending is invariably disastrous—how can the bank make good loans when it is owned by the borrower?” Rajan and Acharya asked. The RBI has allowed universal banking licences to be on-tap basis since 2016. But, no licences have been issued since 2014.
In the previous rounds, when the RBI had issued private bank licences, the banking regulator had permitted corporate houses to apply, but turned down their applications, and preferred financial institutions which had experience in banking transactions.
The last time (2013-14) when the RBI invited applications for new private banks, a host of corporates including Tata Sons; the Aditya Birla Nuvo, part of the Aditya Birla conglomerate; L&T Finance Holdings, part of India's largest engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro; Reliance Capital; and INMACS Management Services Ltd, which provides management consultancy, corporate finance, audit, tax, and legal advisory services, had applied for permits.
Only Bandhan and IDFC got licences.
The RBI has issued bank licences in three rounds since liberalisation. In the first round in 1993-94, the RBI gave licences to 10 private sector banks, namely Global Trust Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, UTI Bank Ltd (renamed Axis Bank Ltd), Bank of Punjab, IndusInd Bank Ltd, Centurion Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank Ltd, Times Bank, and Development Credit Bank Ltd. Some of these banks do not exist now as they were acquired by stronger banks.
In 2003-04, two more banks were given licences—Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd. In 2014 IDFC First Bank and Bandhan Bank were given the licence. Rajan and Acharya listed some of the potential reasons for not letting corporations enter banking.

Buoyed by asset growth (16% YoY), stable NIMs (2.35%) and lower provisions PAT at Rs 5.9bn (PLe: Rs 5.6bn) recorded healthy 26% YoY growth in Q3FY19 for LICHF. While loan traction (16.3% YoY growth) exceeded expectations, project loans (84% YoY growth, 27% YoY disbursements growth) continue to dominate incremental growth. Past two quarters have also observed increased share of non-individual mix, namely; LAP and developer mix catching up to 6.3% and 16.5% levels which have aided yields & margins in the current testing times. Moreover, meaningful asset re-pricing 70bps in past 6 months led to expansion in reported yields at ~10.45% despite CoF climbing to 8.45% resulting into steady margins at 2.33% on sequential basis. Asset quality performance stood mixed bag with developer GNPAs improving sharply by 389bps YoY/204bps QoQ to 6.2% whereas individual home loan NPAs spiking 44bps to 0.93%. While consolidation in smaller HFCs, increased floating rate loans and continued pacing up of non-individual loan traction augmented business momentum for company in Q3, competitive intensities (especially from banks) should restrict growth to 15-16% over FY19-21E. With minimal levers to NIM expansion ahead and dissatisfactory performance on NPA since past few quarters, we foresee NIMs normalizing to 2.3% levels and GNPAs climbing moderately higher to 1.2-1.25% over FY19-21E. RoAs at 1.2% over FY19-FY21E, LICHF fails to exhibit sustainable strong earnings and business trends and hence re-rating stands distant despite lower valuations.
Outlook
Reiterate Accumulate for a price target of Rs 537 (unchanged) as we value the company at 1.5x at Sep'21 PBV.

Post the completion of transaction, Biocon Ltd will hold 89.89 per cent stake in Biocon Biologics on a fully diluted basis.
""This investment is an endorsement of the value that Biocon Biologics business has built as a fully integrated pure-play biosimilars company and will enable us to expand our capabilities further,"" said Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Executive Chairperson of Biocon.
""We welcome ADQ as our investment partner as we pursue our shared goal of expanding access to high-quality, affordable biopharmaceuticals to patients across the globe,"" she said in a statement on Thursday.
Christiane Hamacher, CEO and Managing Director of Biocon Biologics, said the ADQ equity funding in Biocon Biologics endorses the value of company's business model and strengthens its resolve to be the global leader in biologics, delivering affordable access to innovative and inclusive healthcare solutions, transforming patients' lives.
Mohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, Chief Executive Officer of ADQ, said: ""Our long-term ambition for ADQ's healthcare and pharma portfolio is to create a provision-centred, digitally enhanced ecosystem that is anchored in world-class clinical excellence, effective population health management and resilient supply chain infrastructure.""

The instrument, which has the highest AAA credit rating, has a face value of ₹1,000 apiece and investors need to apply for a minimum of 10 NCDs worth ₹10,000.
The NCDs will have tenures of three, five and ten years and will pay investors 8%, 8.05%, and 8.10%, respectively. Investors could choose the annual or cumulative option for all three maturities, while the monthly interest payment option where the company pays 7.8% annually is available only for the 10-year option.

YES Bank surges 9%
Shares of YES Bank jumped 9.49 per cent to close at Rs 91.15 amid reports that DHFL is likely to announce a deal with special situations investor AION Capital for a majority stake in the housing finance company. The deal would lead to an infusion of $1.5 billion into the debt-ridden firm. With this, DHFL promoters’ family stake is likely to come down to 10 per cent. No big haircut to lenders is likely. SBI, YES Bank, Union Bank and Bank of Maharashtra are among key lenders to the NBFC.

This comes amid Moody’s on Tuesday downgrading the lender’s ratings, giving it a negative outlook due to issues in transition of the top leadership.
Sources told BusinessLine the bank’s two promoter groups — those of Rana Kapoor and Madhu Kapur — are now at an advanced stage of talks, discussing the provisions of the draft consent agreement. “The consent agreement is likely to be signed soon as both promoter groups are keen to work together to recommend the next MD and CEO,” said a person close to the development.
Under the draft agreement, both the groups will have equal rights and parity in information sharing. They will also jointly recommend the non-executive Chairman and MD and CEO of YES Bank.
Each group will also recommend one non-executive director each to the board and jointly recommend the third non-executive director. “All appointments will be subject to board and RBI approval,” said the source.
The YES Bank board is set to meet on December 13, by which time the agreement is likely to be hammered out.
Moody’s downgrade
But in fresh trouble for the private sector lender, Moody’s has downgraded its ratings to non-investment grade and changed the outlook to negative from stable on the back of various resignations from the board.
“The rating action considers the resignation of various members of the bank’s board of directors which, when seen in conjunction with the RBI directive in September 2018 to restrict the term of the bank’s MD and CEO as well as founder, Rana Kapoor, till 31 January, 2019, have raised Moody’s concerns over corporate governance,” it said in a statement.
While the rating agency believes the bank's reported credit fundamentals remain stable, the developments surrounding the transition in leadership and governance issues are credit negative because they complicate management's effective implementation of the bank's long-term strategy. “Furthermore, these developments could constrain the bank's ability to raise new capital,” Moody’s said.
It has downgraded foreign currency issuer rating to ‘Ba1’ from ‘Baa3’, and also the bank’s baseline credit assessment (BCA) and adjusted BCA to ‘ba2’ from ‘ba1’ The rating implies that these instruments are non-investment grade, speculative. The outlook, where applicable, has been changed to negative from stable.
Shares of the Bank fell 2.55 per cent and closed at ₹183.15 apiece on the BSE.

The resulting credit squeeze has left builders such as Radius and Omkar Realtors & Developers Pvt. looking for support, or, like scandal-hit Housing Development & Infrastructure Ltd., filing for bankruptcy.

Ashish Shah is caught in the middle of India’s latest financial crisis. As chief operating officer of Radius Developers, he’s struggling to fund construction of apartment complexes because of a liquidity crunch in the nation’s bloated shadow-banking sector.
“Real estate is a sitting duck,” said Shah. “The timing is very crucial as the slowdown has hit the real estate market quite hard. The industry can’t service interest, new interest, additional interest, because there is no cash flow.”
Radius and hundreds of other developers relied on loans from what India calls non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to fuel a five-year property boom. That came to a halt a year ago with the default of one of the shadow banking sector’s leading lenders, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd.
The resulting credit squeeze has left builders such as Radius and Omkar Realtors & Developers Pvt. looking for support, or, like scandal-hit Housing Development & Infrastructure Ltd., filing for bankruptcy.
There are $63 billion of stalled residential projects across the country, according to Anarock Property Consultants, and their developers have become locked in a downward spiral with shadow banks. As lenders stop new credit, builders are forced to offload properties. Prices fall, causing more real estate loans to turn sour, pushing more shadow banks toward default.
In turn, that has cast a shadow on traditional banks and dried up funding to other businesses, putting more stress on an already slowing economy.
Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd. and Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd., which have some of the largest exposures to the sector, are also tightening funding.
The risks of exposure to real estate were underlined by the scandal surrounding HDIL. The Reserve Bank of India abruptly imposed withdrawal curbs on a small cooperative bank that it said had under-reported loans to the developer. The decision triggered panic withdrawals from the bank, prompting the RBI to issue a statement to reassure the public that the banking system is “safe and stable.”
The stresses in the banking industry are an added headache for the RBI as it prepares to cut rates, expected in a decision today, to counter slowing growth.
Some commercial banks that lent to developers and shadow finance firms -- notably Yes Bank Ltd. -- have been caught up in the crisis. Banks had boosted overall lending to NBFCs by more than 50% over the past five years, to about $96 billion or nearly 8% of their total exposure.
Yes Bank shares have led the declines in bank stocks, dropping more than 80% in the past six months, including a 13% slump this week. Its proportion of stressed loans could rise to more than 12%, from a net bad debt of 2.9%, according to Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Ashish Gupta.
Yes Bank Chief Executive Officer Ravneet Gill said his bank only had exposure to three NBFCs. “There is a general perception that there is a closer linkage between Yes Bank and NBFCs than actually exists,” he said in an interview on Thursday.
“The biggest risk is, at its core, a liquidity crisis. A liquidity crisis left unattended balloons into a solvency crisis,” said former Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao, who steered India through the 2008 global downturn. While he doesn’t see any local bank going down in the current scenario, “some weak non-bank finance companies should be allowed to fail for the entire financial system to come out stronger,” he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration and the RBI have taken steps to try to improve cash flow to shadow lenders, including allowing banks to lend more to the sector, providing partial credit guarantees, and easing banks’ mandatory liquidity ratios.
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the bank is closely monitoring the top 50 NBFCs who contribute about 75% of the sector’s loans, and it won’t allow another systemically important NBFC to fail.
Meanwhile non-real estate borrowers are getting caught in the cross-fire. India’s shadow banks catered to a third of new lending until a year ago, and the tightening of new financing has hit businesses from tailors to automakers and affected some of the nation’s biggest business conglomerates, including Anil Ambani’s troubled group, Essel Group Ltd. and Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd.
Slowing property sales in a flagging economy make it even harder for many shadow-lenders to get funding, including Clearwater-backed Altico Capital India Ltd., which defaulted on repayments last month.
“The Achilles heel for the real estate sector is weak sales velocity, which has a direct impact on cash flows,” said Saswata Guha, director of financial institutions at Fitch Ratings. “At some point it is bound to have a cascading effect if unresolved.”
About $24 billion of shadow bank loans to developers could sour in the coming two years, according to estimates from Anarock.
Roots of the Crisis
The crisis has its roots in a lending binge by shadow banks between 2013 and 2018. Commercial banks were trying to chip away at a mountain of bad loans to large infrastructure and energy projects, so shadow lenders moved in, doubling their loan total to $438 billion in four years.
Most of the new financing went to builders, home loans, and debt-laden infrastructure projects, according to rating company ICRA Ltd. In comparison, commercial banks’ lending rose just 46% to $1.36 trillion during the period.

When IL&FS defaulted, the funds dried up, and risks on banks’ balance sheets started rising. Total bad loans could rise to a record 12% by early next year, according to Credit Suisse and Fitch Ratings.
“A few months back we were essentially looking just at the real estate sector, but now the broader economic slowdown can affect other sectors and their creditworthiness,” said Fitch’s Guha.
But saving an NBFC from collapse would mean forcing a bank to absorb all or part of its bad debt. So while Das is leaning toward enforcing market discipline on NBFCs, borrowers like Radius are worried the crisis will continue.
“The reliance on NBFCs has heavily hit cash flows,” said Radius’ Shah, who hopes the measures taken by policy makers will help the sector. “The need for more money is acute.”

These funds are now required to invest a minimum of 75 percent of their assets in equity and equity-related instruments from 65 percent earlier.
On September 13, the regulator issued a clarification, reemphasising that mutual funds should be true to label and stick to appropriate benchmarking, indicating its seriousness to implement the circular strictly.
The SEBI said it was conscious of market stability and that is why it had given the industry time till January 31, 2021, to meet the new minimum limit norms pertaining to multi-cap funds.
All mutual funds are required to comply with the latest provisions by the first week of February 2021.

(DHFL) at the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal.
This will be the first instance of bankruptcy proceedings against a financial services company, after the government issued a notification earlier this month specifying the categories of financial service providers that can be taken up for resolution under the generic framework of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
“The Reserve Bank today filed an application for initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process against Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited under Section 227 read with clause (zk) of sub-section (2) of Section 239 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016 read with Rules 5 and 6 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudication Authority) Rules, 2019,” the RBI said.
According to the rules, an interim moratorium will start from the date of filing of the application till its admission or rejection.
Earlier, RBI had superseded the board of DHFL and said bankruptcy proceedings would be initiated against the company.
R. Subramaniakumar, former MD and CEO of Indian Overseas Bank, was appointed as the administrator and a three-member committee was formed to assist him.
The mortgage lender, which has been facing a cash crunch over the past one year after banks choked lending, has an overall debt of more than ₹80,000 crore. Banks have an exposure of close to ₹40,000 crore to the company.

In a letter to its employees, a copy of which is with PTI, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), which earlier this month had defaulted on a Rs 1,000-crore loan from Sidbi, has claimed that around Rs 16,000 crore of group liquidity is stuck in claims and termination payments.
""Our monies were used to fund the cost and time overruns caused by concession authority delays in handing over right of way. It is our case that if concession authorities released our monies, which is around Rs 16,000 crore of IL&FS group liquidity and stuck in claims and termination payments, we would not be in the situation that we are in,"" IL&FS said in its letter.
The management also claimed that sufficient clarity will emerge after the September 15 board meeting.
IL&FS, which is credited for building the longest tunnel in the country named Chenani-Nashri tunnel, is sitting on a debt pile of around Rs 91,000 crore and had been junked by rating agencies following the default. Of this, Rs 57,000 crore are bank loans alone, most of which are from state-run lenders.
While IL&FS Transport Network, the holding firm of the group's road assets, has nearly Rs 35,000 crore consolidated debt, IL&FS Financial Services has Rs 17,000 crore of debt, which sits as standard asset for most banks, according to a Nomura India report.
Late last month, IL&FS had said it was planning to divest assets with a view to pare its debt by up to Rs 30,000 crore over the next 18 months and had approved a Rs 4,500-crore rights issue which will be completed by October.
It had identified 25 projects to sell, which the firm claimed will reduce its overall debt by Rs 30,000 crore.
The announcement came amid reports of mortgage lender HDFC, which owns 9 percent of IL&FS, not being inclined to bail out the debt-ridden financier through the rights issue.
State-run LIC is the largest shareholder owning a fourth of the firm's equity, while Orix Corporation of Japan owns 23.5 percent. Other shareholders include Abu Dhabi Investment Authority with 12.5 percent, employees welfare trust with 12 percent, Central Bank of India with 7.67 percent and SBI with 6.42 percent.
The company has also decided to infuse up to Rs 5,000 crore into group companies - IL&FS Financial Services, IL&FS Transportation, IL&FS Energy, IL&FS Environment and IL&FS Education.
Over the years, the company has invested over Rs 1,89,000 crore in infrastructure projects, primarily in surface transport, energy, urban infrastructure and financial services.
Earlier this month, Icra had downgraded its debt by at least nine notches, citing cash crunch. It had reduced the rating on IL&FS' Rs 5,225-crore NCD and Rs 350-crore loans sharply to BB from AA+, a second downgrade after the rating was earlier cut from AAA to AA+ on August 7.
The downgrade had as many as 35 mutual fund schemes getting hit, according to a Nomura report.
On September 4, it came to light that IL&FS had defaulted on a short-term loan of Rs 1,000 crore from Sidbi, while a subsidiary has also defaulted on Rs 500 crore to the development financial institution, which reportedly forced Sidbi to ask its chief general manager in charge of the risk management department to resign.
Separately, Icra recently downgraded to 'D' from 'C' bank debt of Rapid Metrorail Gurgaon South for not making interest payment for August on time. Rapid Metrorail Gurgaon South is a special purpose vehicle sponsored by IL&FS Rail with 65 percent stake and IL&FS Transportation Networks with the balance stake.

Banks recovered close to Rs 55,000 crore from the NCLT resolution, the official said
Public sector banks (PSBs) have recovered close to Rs 1.2 trillion from stressed assets during the financial ended March, primarily helped by resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), an official said.
During the first half of the previous fiscal, banks recovered Rs 60,713 crore from bad loans.
""Due to non-resolution of some big accounts referred under NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal), PSBs could not achieve the resolution target of Rs 1.80 trillion. But, these accounts should be resolved in the current financial year,"" the official said.
Banks recovered close to Rs 55,000 crore from the NCLT resolution, the official said.
""Compared to Rs 74,562 crore in 2017-18, the recovery in the previous financial year nearly doubled to Rs 1.2 trillion,"" the official said.

Two large accounts of Essar Steel and Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd are still pending to be resolved. It is expected that these two accounts should be resolved in the next few months and recoveries from these could be around Rs 50,000 crore.
JSW Steel had revised its offer from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 18,000 crore and later to over Rs 19,000 crore, whereas Tata Steel's last offer was at Rs 17,000 crore after it had refused to revise its bid. ArcelorMittal has made a bid of Rs 42,000 crore for Essar Steel.
According to the official, consolidation among public sector banks and higher recoveries by state-owned lenders will be on the government's agenda in the current financial year. Referring to the liquidity crisis in the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), the official said that there are issues with both solvency and liquidity in these companies.
""The government and the Reserve Bank of India will take adequate measures to address the issues plaguing the NBFC sector,"" the official said.
Many NBFCs, including DHFL and Indiabulls Finance, came under severe liquidity pressure compelling them to bring down their reliance on commercial papers. Ever since the IL&FS crisis erupted, banks have been averse to lending to the sector, which has put them in a tight spot. There are concerns that NBFCs may run out of money, which will lead to defaults.

Under the revised norms, provisioning is required only for the portion of the bank or finance company’s investment in the AIF scheme that is further invested in the debtor company, and not the entire investment in the AIF scheme as required earlier.
Also, investment by lenders in AIFs through intermediaries such as fund of funds or mutual funds are not affected.
In Dec 2023, RBI had asked banks to fully provide for investments in AIFs, which went on to invest in companies that the banks had lent to. The rules were aimed at preventing ‘evergreening’ — an underhand practice where lenders provide more funds to the borrower to repay instalments so that the loans do not have to be classified as bad loans.
“The exclusion of equity shares from the definition of downstream investments works only for investments in listed companies. It fails to account for private equity and venture capital investments which are in the form of compulsory convertible instruments such as CCPS and CCDs. The industry is debating as to whether they would need to convert all their hybrid secured to equity to allow REs to stay invested in their funds,” said Siddarth Pai, co-chair, Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association. Following RBI’s announcement, Piramal Enterprises had made a Rs 3,164-crore provision for its exposure to AIFs.

The scrip tanked 11.32 per cent to Rs 27.80 -- its 52 week low -- on the BSE.
On the NSE, it dropped 11.34 per cent to its one-year low level of Rs 27.75.
CARE on Friday downgraded rating for the company's long-term debt program, market-linked debentures and subordinated debt to CARE D, due to the alleged ""delay"" in payment of interest by one day.
Meanwhile, Reliance Capital has slammed CARE Ratings for downgrading its debt and called actions by the rating agency ""pre-meditated and prejudiced"".
Reliance Capital said there was a delay in payment of interest for non-convertible debentures (NCDs) due to a technical glitch and the payment was made on the next working date.
Reliance Capital said CARE has acted in a pre-meditated and prejudiced manner, and has even suppressed the above facts completely in its rating action letter, thereby making it appear as if the company had defaulted in payment of interest by a day, whereas the reality is documents had been provided to CARE that proved funds had duly been arranged on the due date, and the alleged delay was on account of technical glitches.

This comes in the backdrop of two domestic rating agencies downgrading commercial papers of debt-laden DHFL.
The country's largest lender SBI too said it has been closely monitoring its exposure to the NBFC sector for the past 10 months and taking action as required.
Add Zee News as a Preferred Source
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, during his post policy interaction with the media, said the apex bank is closely monitoring the troubles brewing in the NBFC sector due to the liquidity crisis.
Stating that the RBI is committed to ensuring a robust and well-functioning NBFC sector, Das said, ""The central bank will not hesitate to take whatever steps are required to ensure that the financial stability is not adversely impacted in any manner by any development.""
The comments came following a bond repayment default by Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL), the third- largest pure-play mortgage player, and the resultant rating downgrades of its Rs 850 crore commercial papers to default grade by Crisil and Icra.
Later in a statement, SBI said the overall quality of the NBFC asset portfolio on its books continues to be good.
""Challenges faced by accounts like DHFL have already been factored in when we have given our estimate for the stress that the Bank would have to deal with in FY 19-20 and included in our estimates for slippage and loan loss provisioning for the current financial year,"" it said.
Refuting the credit rationale, DHFL said the action by the rating agencies is extremely surprising as the company has been making and continues to make substantial efforts in ensuring no defaults on any bonds and repayment of its financial obligations.
""These actions are unwarranted and the company is seeking clarification on the rationale that predicts DHFL's inability to service pay outs on the due dates. Such speculative rating rationale is not adequate,"" the housing finance firm said in a statement.
Since September 2018, DHFL has repaid close to Rs 40,000 crore of financial obligations, it said.
To ensure adequate liquidity to meet the repayments, DHFL also sold its strategic retail assets including Aadhar, Avanse and DHFL Pramerica Asset Managers, it said, adding that the company is committed towards ensuring repayment of all its obligations.
Following the rating action, shares of DHFL plummeted nearly 16 per cent. The scrip tanked 15.86 per cent to close at Rs 93.90 on the BSE. During the day, it dived 18 per cent to Rs 91.50 -- its 52-week low.
Crisil in a note Wednesday said the downgrade to 'default' or 'D' reflects delays in debt servicing by DHFL on some of its non-convertible debentures (NCDs) because of inadequate liquidity. The payments were due on June 4, 2019.",review_promoted,credit

Hello There! Good Morning. This is Saloni Goel from ETMarkets.com, and here is all the news you need to start your day
The Headlines:
>> Opec output cut gives North Block big worry
>> Reality bites India's FMCG stocks, stocks down up to 12%
>> FY20 GDP growth now projected below 5%
AND
>> RIL on loan hunt to fund Alok Industries takeover
And We have more. Stay with us.
Let’s first have a quick glance at how the markets are looking like...
Nifty futures on Singapore Exchange traded with a 10 points cut at 7 am (IST), signalling indecisiveness ahead on Dalal Street. Elsewhere in Asia, stocks edged up, catching some of Wall Street’s momentum after surprisingly strong US jobs data although regional gains were capped by concerns about China’s economy
>> MSCI index for Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.3%, with Australian stocks and South Korea's Kospi rose 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.3%
>> US stocks surged on Friday on the back of jobs growth that easily topped analyst expectations. Dow rose 337 points, or 1.2% to 28,015, while S&P500 closed 0.9% higher at 3,145 and the Nasdaq jumped 1% to 8,656.
IN THE CURRENCY MART
The rupee appreciated 9 paise to close at 71.20 against the US dollar on Friday, a day after RBI kept the policy rate unchanged and decided to continue with its accommodative stance to support the economy.
LET ME NOW quickly GO OVER the top news we are tracking this morning.
Finally, reality bites India's FMCG stocks
Valuations of FMCG stocks have finally started correcting, with prices falling between 3% and 12% in the past one month as compared with the marginally positive returns on the Nifty. On an average, shares of FMCG companies are currently trading 15% below their yearly highs as foreign portfolio investors reduced their positions on the sector, citing expensive valuations. According to analysts, earnings outperformance is critical for maintaining premium valuations
Opec output cut gives headache to North Block
North Block’s money managers have a burning problem to deal with besides tepid growth — of likely higher oil import bills. Oil traders on the US-based commodities exchange ICE believe Brent crude will test the 67 dollar per barrel mark in the short term, with Opec and its Russian partner deciding to reduce output by 0.5 million barrels to offset price declines caused by booming US production. Total cuts through March 2020 would be 1.7 mbpd, Opec said on Friday.
FY20 GDP growth now projected below 5%
India's real GDP growth in 2019-20 fiscal is expected to be slightly below 5% as the impact of stimulus measures will take time to filter through to the economy, IHS Markit has said. Latest GDP data for July-September quarter showed a significant further moderation in the pace of economic growth to 4.5%, the weakest in six years, led by manufacturing slump. This compared with the 5% in the previous quarter and 7% a year ago in September quarter of 2018.
RIL seeks to raise Rs 5,000 crore to fund Alok Industries takeover
Reliance Industries is in negotiations with three top banks for a Rs 5,000 crore long-term loan facility to fund its acquisition of textile company Alok Industries in a bankruptcy takeover. India’s biggest company by market value is in talks SBI, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank for financing, four people familiar with the company's plans said. RIL won the right to buy Alok Industries in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code process in March this year.
Meanwhile…
Good News for millions of India’s organised sector employees. They may soon have the option of reducing their provident fund contribution — currently at 12% of basic salary — and therefore increase their take-home pay. Labour ministry officials said this provision is part of the Social Security Code Bill, 2019, approved by the Cabinet and expected to be tabled in Parliament this week. The rationale for allowing lower employee PF contribution is that higher take-home pay may boost consumption, which has been falling, dragging growth down. The Bill, however, retains employers’ PF contribution at 12%
NOW, LET’S HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT SOME OF THE TOP CORPORATE NEWS THIS MORNING
>> Maruti Suzuki India increased its production in November by 4.33% to 1,41,834 units in November as against 1,35,946 units in the year-ago month,
>> Bharti Telecom has sought government nod for infusion of Rs 4,900 crore from Singapore-based Singtel and other foreign entities, a move that would make India’s oldest private telecom operator a foreign entity.

- Per RBI’s recent employment data, India created millions of jobs even during the pandemic lockdowns, and has maintained a steady growth since.
- RBI released its data days after Citi Research said that even a 7% GDP growth may not be enough to meet the country’s job requirements over the next decade
Mumbai/New Delhi: A recent dataset on employment has thrown a curveball at economists tracking India’s economy, with several of them trying to wrap their heads around how the country managed to add a large number of jobs the past few years despite the covid-19 shock.
India is estimated to have created 108.9 million between fiscal years 2019-20 and 2023-24, significantly higher than the 76.8 million jobs added between FY06 and FY20, as per provisional data released by the Reserve Bank of India on 8 July.
In 2023-24 alone, India is estimated to have added 46.7 million jobs.
To be sure, RBI emphasised in a statement accompanying the data that it had attempted “a provisional estimate of productivity"" for the first time for FY24 based on available information.
“The data shows there was growth in employment even during the two pandemic years, as per the KLEMS data. It is a bit hard to reconcile…,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda, “but I understand from the methodology that RBI has used the PLFS (Periodic Labour Force Survey) data for extrapolations.""
The addition of jobs also does not match recent government data showing weak consumption growth, he added. “The only explanation could be that because of inflation, people were only spending on food and the real consumption part has declined.""

RBI released its employment data days after Citi Research said in a 4 July report that given India’s demographic dividend, even a 7% GDP growth might not be enough to meet the country’s job requirement over the next decade, under reasonable assumptions.
India issued a rebuttal on 8 July, on the same day the RBI report was released, stating that the Citi report had failed to account for the “comprehensive and positive employment data available from official sources such as the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) and the Reserve Bank of India’s KLEMS data"".
KLEMS refers to the RBI database that measures capital (K), labour, energy, material, and services to gauge productivity at the industry level.
When quantity trumps quality
Despite the apparent surge in employment, economists are not too enthused with the quality of jobs being created, given that employment in lower-pay brackets such as agriculture and trade has seen better growth.
Sabnavis pointed out that growth in India’s real gross domestic product (GDP) had declined in recent years—from about ₹43 trillion during FY2014-19 to about ₹33 trillion between FY19 and FY24.
“However, the KLEMS data shows that job creation has gone up substantially in the same period. It could mean that we are creating jobs in very low-productivity areas,"" he said.
RBI’s KLEMS data show that even as the pandemic resulted in a sharp drop in global employment rates, India witnessed an increase, with as much as 15% more people finding a job in 2020-21—the peak of covid-19 curfews—than in 2018-19.

“Prior to covid-19, jobs in agriculture were shrinking, signalling rising urbanisation and reducing overemployment within this sector, a sign of equitable development. But since covid-19, this trend has reversed, sparking concerns around a prolonged K-shaped recovery,"" said Debopam Chaudhuri, chief economist at Piramal Enterprises Ltd.
According to Chaudhuri, India’s agriculture and allied sectors absorbed a vast number of displaced urban workers—mainly from small businesses—who chose to migrate back to their rural homes due to the pandemic and lockdowns in 2020-21.
However, owing to the nature of these jobs, Chaudhuri said, value addition to the Indian economy took a severe hit, reflected in the labour productivity—value added per employed person per year—estimates provided in the KLEMS database.
Spokespersons of the ministries of finance, labour and employment, and RBI did not respond to emailed queries.Mint also reached out to the secretary of the ministry of labour and employment but did not receive a response.
Scope for improvement
Mitali Nikore, economist and founder of economic research group Nikore Associates, pointed out that the labour quality index has not shown much improvement over the previous three years, indicating that wage growth has been slow across sectors.
Nikore’s analysis shows how job creation trends varied across sectors in the pre-covid-19, during covid-19, and post-covid-19 years.
Almost 30 million jobs were generated in the agriculture sector during FY19 and FY20, and 22 million jobs in the services sector. During FY21-FY22, nearly 18 million jobs were created in the agriculture sector. But in FY23, job-creation in the services sector was higher than in agriculture.

Government officials point to the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) data to assert that more people are joining formal jobs.
While there has been a consistent improvement since the pandemic in key labour market indicators—including increased labour force participation rate (LFPR) and worker population ratio (WPR)—there is scope for improvement on the jobs front, said a senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
“I firmly believe that job creation will increase further as the economy clocks consistent high growth in the medium term,"" the official said.
Experts said a problem in assessing job creation in the economy is the absence of data capturing the trends for a longer period. The best source, the Census, was last done in 2011, these experts pointed out.
Manoranjan Sharma, chief economist at Infomerics Ratings and former chief economist at Canara Bank, said the Union government’s thrust on sectors such as construction, trade, transport, and storage had a salubrious impact on overall employment.
“The covid-19 pandemic in India, as in most countries, devastated income, output, and employment,"" Sharma said. “But post-pandemic, there was a pent-up demand and growth has now not only stabilised but also gained traction.""

The reason: By doing so, banks will be encouraged to keep the funding tap open for NBFCs to meet their PSL target. And NBFCs (especially the mid- and small-size ones) can use the funds, which became tough to mobilise after the IL&FS and DHFL debt default crisis, to originate fresh loans and stay in business.
Banks are staring at a steep agriculture credit (disbursement) target of ₹15-lakh crore in FY21, as outlined in the Budget.
The Budget did not specify any agriculture credit target. Against the agriculture credit target of ₹11-lakh crore for FY19, banks actually disbursed about ₹12.50-lakh crore.
Win-win proposition
The extension of the validity of the circular by, say a year, could be a win-win proposition for both banks and NBFCs, say industry experts.
While the larger NBFCs, which are either standalone or have the backing of a strong corporate/ financial institution, are able to get bank loans without any hitch; the mid- and smaller-size NBFCs are still finding the going tough as banks have turned conservative.
The circular on lending by banks to NBFCs (other than micro finance institutions) for on-lending to specified segments within PSL — agriculture, MSEs and housing — was issued on August 13, 2019. The instructions contained in the circular are valid up to March 31, 2020 and are slated for review thereafter.
PSL includes loans given to segments such as agriculture; micro, small and medium enterprises; export credit; education; housing; social infrastructure; renewable energy. Banks are required to meet the statutory PSL target of 40 per cent of adjusted net bank credit or credit equivalent amount of off-balance sheet exposure, whichever is higher. Experts opined that the RBI may also relax the stipulation in the circular that restricts bank credit to NBFCs for on-lending to 5 per cent of an individual bank’s total PSL on an ongoing basis.
Umesh Revankar, MD & CEO, Shriram Transport Finance Company, said: “In the last six months, the RBI has opened up one more avenue for banks to achieve their priority sector lending — lending by them to NBFCs for on-lending to the agriculture, MSEs and housing is classified as PSL. This was not available earlier.
“However, this has been restricted to 5 per cent of their PSL target. That means on total lending, it will be only 2 per cent.”

Instead of providing a much-expected liquidity window to non-bank finance companies via the regular lenders, the central bank took a tougher stance on Friday by issuing draft guidelines requiring most NBFCs to set aside a liquidity buffer by investing in high-quality liquid assets, primarily sovereign bonds.
“The regulator won’t bail out any particular company but will ensure the NBFCs are more disciplined and strong at the cost of some short-term pain,” said Avinash Singh, research analyst at SBICAP Securities, a subsidiary of State Bank of India. If implemented, the draft guidelines could hit the NBFCs’ margins and business growth, Singh added.
India’s shadow lenders have been under pressure since last year, when a series of defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services forced the government to intervene and exposed weaknesses in the sector. Since then, the banks and mutual funds which provided funding to the NBFCs have reduced their exposure, creating a cash crunch which caused the shadow lenders to sell assets and restrict new loans.
RBI unveiled proposals for a new liquidity framework for NBFCs which it said it planned to introduce in the four years starting in April 2020. The RBI said the firms play an important role in the Indian financial system, especially in providing credit to the retail and small-company sectors.
Default Danger
Larger NBFCs would be less affected by the new measures because they have already started maintaining a liquidity buffer since the IL&FS problems last year, said analysts at IDFC Securities. Well-rated firms have seen their costs of funds revert to pre-crisis levels, according to a Saturday report by Mahrukh Adajania and Sanket Chheda.
However, longer term funds aren’t easily available and the sector is still vulnerable to a default by one of the stressed NBFCs or housing finance firms, the IDFC report said. “That will again lead to a spike in marginal cost of funds and drying up of liquidity for the NBFC sector,” the analysts wrote.
Reliance Capital Chairman Anil Ambani urged the government and the RBI to act quickly to create a liquidity window in an interview published Tuesday in the Economic Times. The sector is in a “full-blown crisis” and the authorities should “look into this urgently,” Ambani was quoted as saying.
Any such liquidity window is expected to use commercial banks as intermediaries, similar to the arrangement the central bank put in place in 2008, during the global financial crisis.
The government of Narendra Modi, which received a sweeping new mandate in elections last week, is signaling a tough line with individual shadow lenders, while not ruling out measures to avert a credit crunch.
“Should there be a need to address the contagion we will do everything that is necessary to keep the credit market functional,” said Sanjeev Sanyal, principal economic adviser at the Finance Ministry. “However we have to be aware of the moral hazard of intervening in every disruption. Otherwise, we will end up perpetuating and encouraging asset-liability mismatch,” Sanyal added.

The ruling came on a complaint filed by an Ahmedabad-based group of four individuals who had availed housing loan worth over Rs 47 lakh from Indiabulls in 2008.
NEW DELHI: Fair trade regulator CCI Wednesday dismissed a complaint alleging unfair and discriminatory trade practices by Indiabulls Housing Finance regarding loan agreement. Disposing of the complaint, the regulator said prima facie the case does not contravene the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of the Competition Act.
Section 3 and 4 pertain to anti-competitive agreement and abuse of dominant market position, respectively.
The ruling came on a complaint filed by an Ahmedabad-based group of four individuals who had availed housing loan worth over Rs 47 lakh from Indiabulls in 2008.
The complainant alleged that Indiabulls arbitrarily increased the interest rate from 16 per cent to 22.75 per cent and even after paying over Rs 73 lakh, the finance company kept the principal amount due at over Rs 44 lakh.
Besides, they alleged that the company is charging the highest possible rate of interest from them while the rate of interest charged to other consumers is different and substantially less.
By doing so, the company contravened Section 3 and 4 of Competition Act, the complainant alleged.
For the case, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) considered the ""provision of loan against property in India"" as the relevant market and did not find Indiabulls in a dominant position.
Therefore, in the absence of dominance, the issue of abuse of dominant position against Indiabulls does not survive, CCI said in an eight-page order.
Accordingly, the fair trade regulator dismissed the complaint after finding no contravention of the Competition Act.
Section 3 and 4 pertain to anti-competitive agreement and abuse of dominant market position, respectively.
The ruling came on a complaint filed by an Ahmedabad-based group of four individuals who had availed housing loan worth over Rs 47 lakh from Indiabulls in 2008.
The complainant alleged that Indiabulls arbitrarily increased the interest rate from 16 per cent to 22.75 per cent and even after paying over Rs 73 lakh, the finance company kept the principal amount due at over Rs 44 lakh.
Besides, they alleged that the company is charging the highest possible rate of interest from them while the rate of interest charged to other consumers is different and substantially less.

The stock was trading 2.99 per cent down to Rs 45.35 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the Natioanl Stock Exchange (NSE).
India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) backed the downgrade saying the private sector lender failed to meet the expectations with respect to equity infusions.
According to the rating agency, the liquidity position of the bank seemed adequate at end-September 2019.
In the absence of improvements on the capital side, the ability of the bank to manage its asset and liability maturities might be tested further, it said.
“The downgrade reflects the inadequate progress as per Ind-Ra’s expectations with respect to the quantum and pace of equity infusions, which is critical for providing sufficient cushion for the credit cost impact of the stressed asset pool,” India Ratings and Research said on Wednesday.
The bank is likely to face balance sheet expansion challenges over the short-to-medium term, it added.

Buying emerged in metals and to some extent in FMCG names, which helped the benchmark indices at the end.
Here are a few key trends seen in Friday’s session:
Pharma worst sector this week
Nifty Pharma was the worst performing sectoral index during the week gone by as investors preferred to book profit after a sharp rise over the past month. Even on Friday, the index dropped 0.86 per cent dragged by Lupin, Glenmark Pharma, Sun Pharma, Cadila Healthcare, Divi’s Labs and Biocon, which slid 1-3 per cent.
Auto best weekly performer
Nifty Auto index was the best performer on NSE as it climbed 5 per cent in five sessions after companies resumed work in their factories. On Friday though, the index slipped 1 per cent dragged by Ashok Leyland, M&M, Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor.
Insider trading: Sachet Metals, Solara Pharma
213 stocks hit upper circuit
Over 200 stocks hit the upper circuit limits set by BSE on Friday, which included Jubilant Life Sciences, Zensar Technology, ITDG, Shankara Building Projects, SpiceJet, Reliance Capital and Edelweiss Financial, among others.
Stocks that gave buy signals
As many as 57 BSE-listed stocks gave buy signals during the session as they crossed above the signal line on the MACD indicator. They included India Cements, Sanghi Industries, Udaipur Cement, Alembic, Himalaya Food, Emami and Praj Industries, among others.
Stocks that gave sell signals
Some 69 stocks gave sell signals as they crossed below the signal line. They included McLeod Russel, Infosys, Shriram Transport Finance, LIC Housing Finance, MindTree, Nocil, Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilisers and Balrampur Chini, among others.
17 stocks overbought
Thanks to brisk buying in last few days, some 17 stocks turned overbought on BSE as they crossed above the 70-mark on the RSI indicator. They included Hindustan Zinc, Mahindra EPC, Salasar Techno Engineering, Apollo Micro Systems, Blackrose Industries and Cigniti Technologies, among others.
Where is Nifty headed?
Optimism was evident in the market since the morning trades and the Nifty bounced back from the lows to close in a recovery pattern towards the end of the day. Traders lapped up stocks on hopes of a bold announcement by the FM on the stimulus package front, said analysts. “Technically, the double bottom formation has formed in oversold markets and at least we can expect the Nifty to move closer to 9,300. However, it is mandatory to keep a stop loss at 9,040,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities.

The rating downgrade was attributed to continued delay and inconclusive quantum of the anticipated equity infusion in YES Bank.
Ind-Ra opined that the delay in capital infusion could adversely impact the bank's franchise and potentially create challenges on asset and liability side. The bank has sizable foreign currency liabilities and institutional deposits.
""This rating action is a follow up of the rating rationale published by the agency on January 28, 2020, where the agency had stated that the rating would be reviewed in February 2020,"" Ind-Ra said in a report.
The cash-strapped bank continues to remain in discussions with various potential investors, but has failed to reach a conclusive outcome. In December, YES Bank in a filing to the bourses disclosed that its board was willing to favourably consider London-based Citax Holdings' $500 million offer, adding that it would continue to evaluate other potential investors to raise capital upto $2 billion. Among others who showed willingness for fund infusion were US-based Capital International ($120 million), GMR Group and Associates ($50 million), billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's wife Rekha Jhunjhunwala ($25 million) and Aditya Birla Family Office ($25 million).
Also Read: YES Bank gets shareholders' approval to raise up to Rs 10,000 crore
Last month, YES Bank rejected $1.2 billion investment offer made by Canadian industrialist Erwin Singh Braich/SPGP Holdings.
According to Ind-Ra, the capital infusion is critical for providing sufficient cushion to the possible credit cost impact from the stressed asset pool on regulatory capital requirement in the short and medium-term, as well as for the bank's ability to continue to serve its customers adequately.
Although the liquidity position of the YES Bank seemed adequate at end-September 2019 (liquidity coverage ratio of 114 per cent), but in the absence of any swift capital raise, the bank's ability to manage its asset and liability maturities could get tested further, the report said.

Ind-Ra said that raising sizeable capital in the very near term could be challenging and could require various regulatory and other approvals. The rating could be reviewed towards the end of February 2020.
For rating AT1 instruments, Ind-Ra considered the discretionary component, coupon omission risk, and write-down/conversion risk as the key parameters. The agency has recognised the unique going concern loss absorption features of these bonds and differentiated them from the bank's senior debt (by three notches in this case). Ind-Ra envisages coupon deferrals and principal write-down risk as a modest possibility in view of YES Bank's revenue reserve buffers.
Last week, YES Bank received shareholders' nod to raise capital up to Rs 10,000 crore via issuance of equity shares or other convertible securities. At the Extraordinary General Meeting, the lender also received approval to increase authorised share capital of the bank to Rs 1,100 crore from Rs 800 crore.

On BSE, the scrip debuted at Rs 360.50, down 2.04 per cent.
The IPO, which was commanding a grey market premium of Rs 35 a few days ago, quoted at a discount of Rs 2 in the grey market on Monday. This is even as rating agency CRISIL upgraded Fusion Micro Finance's long-term rating on the bank facilities and debt instruments to ‘CRISIL A/Stable’ from ‘CRISIL A-/Stable’.
The issue, which was sold from November 2 to November 4 in the Rs 350-368 price band, got a total of 2.95 times subscription. The issue was commanding a grey market premium of Rs 35 when the IPO was announced. However, the premium fell amid muted investor response to the issue.
Analysts had advised investors with good risk appetite, who can stay invested for a long-period of time, to 'subscribe' to the issue. They said financial ratios for Fusion Micro Finance were solid and the overall fundamentals were good, but there were industry-related concerns.
Competition from other MFIs, banks and financial institutions and substantial collections and disbursements in cash were also seen as risks.
CRISIL, meanwhile, said its upward revision in the rating was driven by substantial increase in capital position of the company and expected improvement in profitability.
""Fusion Micro Finance has completed raising fresh equity of Rs 600 crore recently which is 43 per cent of existing networth, as per the CRISIL Rating report. Post this capital raise, Fusion’s overall networth will rise over Rs. 2,000 crore from Rs. 1,416 crore as of June 30, 2022,"" it said.
Fusion Micro Finance provide financial services to underserved women across India. The company’s focus customer segment is women in rural areas with an annual household income of up to Rs 3,00,000. As of June 30, 2022, the company had 2.90 million active borrowers, which were served by its network of 966 branches and 9,262 employees spread across 377 districts in 19 states and union territories in India. Fusion Micro Finance had the fourth fastest gross loan portfolio CAGR of 53.89 per cent between the financial years 2017 and 2021.
At the upper limit of the price band, the asking IPO valuations stood at 1.9 times adjusted FY22 book value per share (BVPS) and 168 times FY22 diluted EPS.
The issue comprised a fresh issuance of equity shares worth Rs 600 crore and an offer of sale of 1,36,95,466 equity shares by promoters and existing shareholders. The price band for the same is fixed at 350-368 per share.
The net proceeds of the fresh issue would be used to augment the capital base of the microfinance firm.

Some of the country’s most important companies are facing serious troubles that reflect both their own management issues and also the state of the broader economy.
The key non-banking financial company, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services, went bust last year. India’s oldest private airline, Jet Airways, has crash-landed. When Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communication filed for bankruptcy in May, the businessman needed a last-gasp bailout from his elder brother, Mukesh Ambani, to avoid contempt of court and potentially jail time.
Then, on June 5, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd, better known as DHFL, has seen its commercial paper – short-term debt instruments – downgraded to “D”, meaning default. In other words, ratings agencies do not expect DHFL to be able to pay back the short-term debts it owes in full – including about Rs 850 crore of commercial paper.
What happened at DHFL?
DHFL is a non-banking financial company, also known as a shadow bank. This means it doesn’t have a banking licence or access to central bank liquidity, but is nevertheless involved in financial services – in this case, primarily giving loans to home buyers in India’s tier 2 and tier 3 cities.
In 2018, another major NBFC, IL&FS, went bust, causing alarm bells to ring throughout the industry. Banks became much more careful about lending money to NBFCs. But this led to a liquidity crunch, since there was limited access to credit. Many NBFCs rely on short-term borrowing to finance long-term lending, which puts them in a difficult spot when there is a liquidity crunch.
In September 2018, after the IL&FS crisis emerged, DHFL’s stock also took a hammering, by as much as 60%. Then, in January, Cobrapost claimed that the company’s promoters were involved in a Rs 31,000 crore scam to siphon off money. The company denied these claims and later said that an independent chartered accountant’s inquiry found them to be untrue.
Nevertheless, the combination of factors put DHFL in a difficult place, forcing the company to sell a number of its businesses to ensure it could pay back on debt. Regardless, on June 4, the company failed to pay about Rs 900 crore worth of interest, prompting ratings agencies to downgrade all of its commercial paper .
What does this mean?
The company insists that this is only a temporary problem and has said that it will pay back the amount within the seven-day grace period. If it is able to do so, this will allay some fears about this being an “insolvency issue” – whether the company itself can survive. Instead, it will become just a “liquidity issue”, suggesting the company just needs more time to mobilise money.
DHFL has insisted that the underlying assets that it holds, a big chunk of which are house loans, are valuable and have a very low non-performing asset percentage. But those underlying assets are worth about Rs 1 lakh crore. As a consequence, if this is indeed a solvency issue, if the company’s survival itself is uncertain, it could be a huge blow to India’s financial markets. This will lead to further panic – and tighter liquidity – across the system.
If the company fails, that will affect all of those that have extended credit to the company. That includes about Rs 50,000 crore from banks, another Rs 30,000 crore from the Life Insurance Corporation, pension funds and more. In other words, this isn’t about just one company failing: it is a danger to the already-beleaguered banking system.
What does it mean for mutual funds?
One sector has already been affected: mutual funds, which allow investors to put their money into a selection of stocks as picked by a fund manager. Indian regulations mean that once payments have missed their due date, ratings agencies have to move immediately to change the rating of the company, in this case move DHFL down to “D”. Subsequently, mutual fund companies have to immediately follow suit, and mark down all DHFL debt 75%.
That means that, if a mutual fund owns DHFL debt – even if it is not the bonds that the company was unable to pay in time – it has to be marked down 75%. UTI Mutual Fund, for example, which owns a large amount of DHFL paper has written down all of that debt completely, meaning it doesn’t expect to get anything back.
This may change if DHFL does indeed manage to pay the money back by Monday as promised. But regulations mean ratings agencies cannot immediately change the company’s grade. As a result, mutual funds and their clients will have to be prepared to not earn that money back and also to guard against speculative investors hoping to make a quick buck.
What about the broader economy?
India’s economy currently faces severe challenges, both domestic and international. In better times, with more money generally in the market, a number of these companies like Jet and DHFL may have found it easier to dig their way out of hole.
But with India’s growth story in danger and a steep drop in consumption, the failure of DHFL could have major repercussions across the economy, which is already struggling to deal with the twin-balance sheet crisis – a high number of non-performing assets and heavily indebted corporates.
A proper default would lead to an even tighter liquidity crunch, further fears about the viability of NBFCs, and a knock-on effect on numerous other industries. It will also command greater regulatory attention, at a time when India’s policy makers and regulators need to be thinking about steadying the ship. Andy Mukherjee of Bloomberg has even suggested that this is the time for a mega bailout, or else things will only get worse.",review_promoted,credit

Yes Bank rose 2.68% to Rs 55.60 after the bank announced sale of shares by one of the promoters group entity.
Yes Bank announced that one of its promoter entities sold a part of its stake yesterday. This sale was effected purely to deleverage the debt of this entity. The board of directors of Yes Bank would like to state that the financial position of the bank is sound & stable, its operating performance continues to be robust and its growth plans stay firmly on track.
Morgan Credits (MCPL), part of the promoter group of Yes Bank, on Thursday sold 2.3% shareholding in the bank.

MCPL had in April 2018 placed rated, zero coupon NCDs amounting Rs 1160 crore with RNAM (the only borrowing of MCPL). These funds were utilized by MCPL towards incubation of new-age start-up businesses. Pursuant to the above sale of shares, which was conducted solely to de-leverage MCPL, the promoter group has achieved total prepayments (including interest) to NCD holders of Rs 722 crore till date, well ahead of the scheduled maturity date of April 2021. The promoter group has reduced total promoter/promoter group ownership in the bank to 15.7% (in further compliance with RBI's regulatory level of 15%), as compared to 18% previously.
Shares of Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management rose 0.19% to Rs 231.35.

India largest IT exporter, TCS plans to ask a vast majority of 75% of its 4.5 lakh employees globally (including 3.5 lakh in India) to work from home by 2025, up from the industry average of 20% today, through a new model called 25/25, which would require far less office space than occupied today.
More Indian companies are likely to follow suit soon.
“We believe that work-life balance is important for enhancing the efficiency of an employee. Since this is a new concept for PSUs, we can explore giving WFH beyond the lockdown to our employees,” said P.K. Singh, Director (Commercial) in-charge of HR – Power Finance Corporation Limited. “Taking a cue from what we have learned during this lock down, work from home can be the order of the day in the coming days. Further, PSUs like PFC can introduce flexi working system. This will create a new work culture and environment. As a result, We will end up with enhanced productivity, increased motivation and work life balance,” he added.
PFC currently has around 300 employees. Since a majority of the workforce is professionally qualified, they are all well-versed with systems.
“Earlier too, the company performed its operations online, but within the confines of office premises. Thus, work from home [WFH] is just an advancement in the use of technology from a remote location. In the current situation, it is the need of the hour. So, employees are making best use of their knowledge and the facilities provided to them by PFC,” said Mr. Singh.
PFC has ensured that none of the work is being postponed or delayed due to the current situation. For an NBFC like PFC, closure of a financial year is the most critical time. The employees rose to the occasion and made exceptional contribution during the last few days of the financial year 2019-20 after the lockdown was announced.
Speaking on the advantages of the WFH model, Singh said, “For a PSU, one needs to evaluate the mechanism. The model definitely helps in cutting off the travel time and in an urban set-up, that might account for nearly 2 to 3 hours of the daily schedule. PFC already has the IT set-up and provisions for employees to be allowed to WFH in future as well. Post the lockdown, the situation may be evaluated with the help of HR unit and accordingly, a decision can be taken,” he said.
According to Mr. Singh, PFC has already provided laptops to the entire workforce. The Virtual Private Network connections were enabled and video-conferencing application was provided to employees for collaboration like video-calling, file sharing and chat purposes.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/why-investors-were-lukewarm-to-sbis-july-at-1-bond-issuance-11114111.html,Why investors were lukewarm to SBI July AT - 1 bond issuance,2023-08-07,moneycontrol.com,,YES Bank,"[{""entity"": ""YES Bank"", ""date"": ""2023-08-22"", ""action_type"": ""upgrade"", ""outcome"": ""positive"", ""days_before"": 15}]","On July 13, the State Bank of India (SBI) issued a new series of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds. The issue was widely viewed as having performed poorly – the bank raised just about a third of what it had set out to do, despite offering a premium of 100 basis points over the interest rates on government securities (G-Secs). This has reportedly spooked several PSU banks that were planning to issue such bonds, compelling them to have second thoughts.
The subpar performance of SBI’s July bond issuance is puzzling because the bank had raised around Rs 3,700 crore through a similar issue at a premium of 66 basis points over the interest rate on G-Secs in the previous quarter. That issue was oversubscribed over two times, suggesting strong investor interest in such bonds as recently as March 2023. In the Rs 10,000 crore July issuance, the bank managed to raise only about 30 percent of the amount. The large size of SBI’s July issue and its long tenure are popularly believed to be responsible for its underperformance. We offer an alternative explanation for this outcome.
In 2020, a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) appointed administrator in Yes Bank’s restructuring process unilaterally decided to wipe out the holders of the AT1 bonds issued in 2016 and 2017 by the beleaguered bank, without writing down its equity shareholders. The administrator’s decision to prefer Yes Bank’s equity shareholders over its bondholders triggered a chain of reactions from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on the one hand and the courts on the other, which explain a general aversion towards AT1 bonds. To the extent that this aversion raises the cost of keeping Indian banks well-capitalised, this has fiscal implications for the government of India, the single largest shareholder of Indian public sector banks. More importantly, this aversion underscores the urgency with which the Supreme Court must decide the challenge to Yes Bank’s bond write-off, scheduled to come up for hearing on August 21.
Appetite for bonds
The success of any bond issue depends on a variety of factors — domestic and global macro-economic conditions, the financial health of the issuer, terms of the issue and investor appetite, and many of these are endogenous to one other. While it is hard to pin down a causal explanation for the underperformance of a bond issuance, an overview of the issuances in the current fiscal suggests that there is an appetite for the bonds of both PSU and non-PSU banks.
The above table dilutes the force of some of the reasons, such as large issue size and longer tenure, that were offered in the press to explain the bond issue’s poor performance. Public and private sector banks have made issues that are comparable to the SBI’s issue in size and maturity in the previous quarter, suggesting that there seems to be a prima facie appetite for large issue sizes with long maturity periods. Also, to be noted is the overall buoyancy in the bond market — over Rs 3.50 lakh crore worth of fresh bonds issued in the first four months of the year.
Regulatory Action Impact
AT1 bonds are contingent convertible bonds, which, unlike vanilla bonds, can be written down or converted into equity shares of the issuer, on the occurrence of pre-defined contingencies, generally linked to the issuer’s financial health. The decision to write off Yes Bank’s AT1 bonds in 2020 prompted SEBI to take several steps to protect investors from the risks inherent in such bonds.
A key step was capping the exposure that mutual funds could take to AT1 bonds and mandating that the bonds be valued by mutual funds at an effective maturity of 100 years. While all the AT1 bonds are ‘perpetual’ bonds de jure, they come with a call option at five years maturity. Banks have exercised this option in all such bonds issued so far, thus making them bonds of five years maturity, de facto. Valuing these bonds at a maturity of 100 years suppresses their valuations, making them unattractive for asset managers. This valuation rule kicked in from April 2023, providing one possible explanation for the undersubscription of SBI’s AT1 bond issuance of July.
Another step taken by SEBI was to restrict retail investors’ access to such bonds, by measures such as raising the minimum allotment value and minimum lot size for secondary trading in these bonds to Rs 1 crore. At about the same time, amidst an outcry over these bonds having been missold to investors, SEBI penalised Yes Bank and its private wealth management team for having sold such bonds to individual investors. These regulatory actions triggered by the AT1 bond write-off are likely to have affected both investor interest and the general distribution chain for selling such bonds.
Uncertainty Generated By Courts
The aversion created by the regulatory restrictions is amplified by the uncertainty created by courts in dealing with the challenge to the write-off. In 2021, some AT1 bondholders challenged the decision of Yes Bank’s administrator to force them to absorb the losses suffered by the bank before equity holders. While the Bombay High Court set aside the administrator’s decision at the beginning of this year, the victory was precariously perched on technicalities and short-lived. In this article, we had critiqued the High Court judgement for not questioning the fairness of the administrator’s decision which upended a cardinal principle of corporate finance of equity shareholders as the first loss absorbers without offering any reasons for doing so. A reasoned determination of this question was critical to the case at hand and for Indian banking generally. The RBI challenged the Bombay High Court’s decision in the Supreme Court and the matter is now awaiting a substantive hearing on merits.
A similar write-off was done in March 2023 by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) in Credit Suisse’s rescue plan, giving this issue a global dimension. The SNB’s decision triggered statements by the ECB and the Bank of England reassuring the public that they would not resort to such write off in restructuring banks in their own jurisdictions. We believe that this would have implications on the way the Indian Supreme Court would look at the decision of Yes Bank’s administrator, if it does decide to look into the merits of the decision.
The underwhelming performance of SBI’s AT1 bond issue is perhaps indicative of the new normal for subordinated bonds issued by banks and financial institutions. Banks may have to significantly increase the premium offered on these bonds, given the uncertainties associated with the loss absorption hierarchies. Meanwhile, it is imperative that the Supreme Court decide the legal challenge on the AT1 bond write-off on merits. Investors need to know what they are buying, and regulators need to know whether their discretion in bank restructuring exercises is unbound or bound by the need to explain extraordinary decisions that reverse the fundamental tenets of corporate finance.

In 3QFY18, ARBL’s revenue grew by 17% YoY to INR 15.5bn, led by healthy volume growth in the Automotive Battery Business. EBITDA grew by 18.5% YoY to INR 2.4bn. EBITDA margin improved 18 bps YoY to 15.6% led by operational improvement. Management guided margins to sustain in the 14-16% range depending on lead price movement. PAT grew by 19.7% YoY to INR 1.3bn, partly aided by higher other income. The Automotive battery business has clocked healthy volume growth across the OE and Aftermarket segments. AMARON and POWER ZONE brands continue to grow on the back of channel expansion initiatives. In Industrial segment, UPS witnessed significant growth during the quarter. Telecom segment continues to be subdued. However, Telecom segment reported volume growth sequentially. During the quarter, exports to South East Asia and Middle East countries have also increased significantly.
Outlook
We introduce FY20E estimates Revenue/EPS 12.3%/20.2% YoY. At CMP, the stock is trading at a valuation of 23.5XFY19E and 19.5XFY20E earnings. We roll over our valuation to FY20E; valuing the company at 23XFY20E EPS to arrive at a target price of INR 945 and maintain a BUY rating.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company Limited (NSE:CHOLAFIN) stock is up an impressive 201% over the last five years. It's also good to see the share price up 18% over the last quarter.
In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Over half a decade, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance managed to grow its earnings per share at 25% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 25%. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
We know that Cholamandalam Investment and Finance has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.
What About Dividends?
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Cholamandalam Investment and Finance the TSR over the last 5 years was 211%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.
A Different Perspective
It's nice to see that Cholamandalam Investment and Finance shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 14% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 25% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute.

While the management believes that the short-term negative impact of free deliveries will be offset by improvements in other revenue and fixed & variable cost drivers, the complexity in forecasting margins keeps the debate raging.
“Basis the initial feedback from a small sample set of customers and the management commentary of visible green shoots in the form of an increase in app opens post the launch, we believe, ceteris paribus, that the Gold launch should certainly drive up order volume. We also believe that the company has enough levers both on revenue (restaurant commission take-rates and ad income) as well as variable cost (such as closure of operations in 225 cities that were loss-making and delivery partner-related efficiencies) that should partially (if not entirely) negate the impact of the free delivery benefit for Gold members,” the note stated.
JM Financial continues to remain bullish on the company’s long-term prospects in the hyperlocal delivery space as we believe it is well positioned to benefit from robust industry tailwinds such as improving tech penetration and rising income share of digitally native millennials / GenZ. Balance sheet also remains robust with net cash of ₹113 bn as of December 2022.
The brokerage house said Zomato remains a long-term story and has Buy rating on Zomato shares with a target price of ₹100 apiece, implying a potential upside of more than 95% from the current stock level.
“We raise our FY23-25 revenue estimates by 3-6% mainly due to strong beat in the Hyperpure business. Simultaneously, we raise our EBITDA margin estimates by 160 bps/220 bps over FY23/FY24 due to lower-than-estimated operating losses in 3QFY23,” it added.
The online food delivery platform reported a widening of consolidated net loss at ₹346.6 crore for the third quarter ended December 2022 impacted by higher expenses and slowdown in food delivery business, as against loss of ₹67 crore year-on-year (YoY).

A day after a sharp fall in its stock price, Yes Bank on Wednesday said the decline was mainly due to forced sale of 10 crore equity shares on the back of invocation of pledged shares by a large stakeholder.
Yes Bank also said its financials are strong, with the liquidity position well in excess of regulatory requirements.
The private sector lender's share price had plunged by nearly 30 per cent during intra-day trade on Tuesday (October 1), before closing the session down by 22.8 per cent at Rs 32.
""This fall was primarily on account of the forced sale of 10 crores equity shares (3.92 per cent of the bank's equity share capital) triggered by an invocation of pledge on the equity shares of a large stakeholder,"" it said in a filing to the stock exchanges.
With this sale, the entire pledge stands extinguished and all sale under the same duly completed, it added.

Stock markets were closed on Wednesday on account of 'Gandhi Jayanti'.
Meanwhile, Reliance Nippon Asset Management Company (RNAM) had on Tuesday directed its trustees to sell the remaining shares pledged by Rana Kapoor, co-founder of Yes Bank, as a collateral with the mutual fund house, sources said.
Kapoor, who is also a promoter of Yes Bank, has less than 5 per cent stake left in the private lender, and the same has been pledged with RNAM.
""RNAM has given instruction to its trustees to sell entire holding of Kapoor in Yes Bank,"" a source had said on Tuesday.
In its filing on Wednesday, Yes Bank also asserted that its financial and operating metrics remain intrinsically stable.
""Over the past few days, unfounded speculations regarding the bank's deposits/liquidity have been brought to its notice. In this regard, kindly note that the bank had a Liquidity Coverage Ratio in excess of 125 per cent as on September 30, 2019, which is well above the minimum regulatory requirement of 100 per cent,"" it said.
The bank's gross advances as on September 30, 2019 stood at Rs 2.32 lakh crore, as against Rs 2.42 lakh crore by June-end 2019, with a higher share of retail advances compared to June, it added.
The reduction in advances was effected to enhance capital efficiency, Yes Bank said.
""Further, deposits aggregated to Rs 2.09 lakh crore as on September 30, 2019. CASA Ratio improved to nearly 30.8 per cent as compared to 30.2 per cent as on June 30, 2019,"" it said.
Kapoor and his group entities had sold 2.16 per cent of their stake in the bank worth Rs 510 crore through open market transaction on September 26-27.
After this, Kapoor and his group entities' stake in the bank came down to 4.72 per cent.
Earlier last week, Yes Capital, one of the promoter entities of Yes Bank, sold 1.8 per cent stake in the private sector lender.
The stake sale helped the promoter group entity mop up around Rs 240 crore.
Last month, another promoter Morgan Credits had sold 2.3 per cent stake in Yes Bank for Rs 337 crore to prepay a certain part of its outstanding dues to Reliance Nippon Life AMC.

Here are trading strategies for stocks that have been in the news over the past few months:
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL): What’s missing in the stock is the significant amount of volumes that can drive the price to higher levels. The volumes are trading below average as per the daily chart, a sign of concern. Its inability has led to several failed breakouts, resulting in negative sentiment and losing upside momentum. Investors and traders need to be cautious as stock trades below 200 DMA, placed at Rs 465 levels. A decisive breakout above the same may alter the current cautious sentiment. Till then, one can opt for Rs 380 as support. However, one needs to be aware that the stock is trading below 50 DMA of Rs 430 as well. CLICK HERE FOR DETAILED CHART VIEW
ICICI Bank Ltd (ICICIBANK): The daily chart suggests the stock is trading in the range of Rs 383 – Rs 402 from mid-March 2019, a consolidation phase whose break out/ break down is determined when it breaches either side levels. Although, the technical oscillator, RSI (Relative strength index) shows negative divergence, the stock has not witnessed heavy selling pressure. The weekly chart suggests a breakout above Rs 378 – Rs 382 levels. If the counter breaks out above the upper resistance of Rs 402, then it may see a rally towards Rs 428 and Rs 442 levels. CLICK HERE FOR DETAILED CHART VIEW
Jet Airways (India) Ltd (JETAIRWAYS): The stock is currently testing the significant support levels of 50 DMA, located at Rs 242.60 levels. The MACD (moving average convergence and divergence) moved up above the zero line when the stock broke out around Rs 270 levels, which is a sign of the trend being supported by respective oscillators. The stock is likely to move towards Rs 285 and Rs 310 levels after it manages to close above 200 DMA, placed at Rs 266 levels. CLICK HERE FOR DETAILED CHART VIEW

Yes Bank Ltd (YESBANK): The weekly chart clearly denotes a bullish breakout heading towards Rs 325 and Rs 348 in the coming sessions. The stock is slowing down the pace at which it ran recently towards Rs 280 levels, as RSI trades in the negative crossover as per daily chart. We may witness sideways trades for a few sessions. However, any mild correction towards Rs 260 - Rs 250 should see buying opportunity emerge. The technical formation stays highly optimistic, as the stock trades well above 200-weekly moving averages (WMA). The MACD (moving average convergence and divergence) also has climbed above the zero line. One needs to look at this in terms of long formation as the trend remains positive. CLICK HERE FOR THE DETAILED CHART
Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL): The stock is currently resisting at 100-day moving average (DMA) located at Rs 177.40 as per daily chart.

While the best companies are hard to find, but they can generate massive returns over long periods. To wit, the Bajaj Finance Limited (NSE:BAJFINANCE) share price has soared 1175% over five years. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors.
We love happy stories like this one. The company should be really proud of that performance!
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During five years of share price growth, Bajaj Finance achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 38% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 66% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 45.27.
You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Bajaj Finance's earnings, revenue and cash flow.
What About Dividends?
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Bajaj Finance's TSR for the last 5 years was 1191%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
A Different Perspective
It's good to see that Bajaj Finance has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 31% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 67% per year, is even more impressive. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you check here to see what price insiders were buying at.",review_promoted,noise

Bajaj Finserv
Pune (Maharashtra) [India], September 7 (ANI/NewsVoir): India ranks as the 10th most prominent life insurance market and the 15th largest non-life insurance market globally, as per the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).
Another recent study found that in 2020-21, the Gross Direct Premium Income (GDPI) of health insurance policies grew by over 13 per cent. However, the accident insurance industry is yet to gain momentum in India.
One of the primary reasons for this is lack of awareness. It is a common misconception that(https://www.bajajfinserv.in/health-insurance) health insurance and personal accident insurance have the same benefits, and most users end up choosing health insurance.
But having a personal accident insurance policy is very important. It can help cover the individual and his/her family financially in the case of mishaps or untoward incidents. With this, one can focus on recovery without worrying about funds to seek quality treatment.
This type of insurance covers all types of accidents: from major mishaps to minor ones, and one can safeguard themselves and their loved ones. With this policy, Bajaj Finance covers all important aspects of personal accident insurance and provides complete financial security during an emergency.
Here are some of the reasons why one should choose personal accident insurance from Bajaj Finance:
1. Coverage for permanent total disability
In the case of an accident that causes total disability (such as loss of vision or speech or, hearing ability) and makes it impossible for the policyholder to continue with their current occupation, the individual can receive compensation from the insurer. Bajaj Finance provides personal accident insurance that offers 125% of the sum insured for total permanent disability.
2. Coverage for partial disability
Personal accident policies also cover partial disability, such as losing a finger(s) or limb in an accident. However, the compensation usually depends on the nature of the disability based on the policy's terms and conditions. In such a scenario, Bajaj Finance provides 100 per cent compensation up to the sum insured under personal accident insurance.
3. Compensation for accidental death
Bajaj Finance also offers 100 per cent compensation up to the sum insured in case of accidental death.
4. Worldwide coverage
One can stay covered against accidents anywhere across the world.
5. Temporary total disability benefits
Temporary disabilities such as fractures are common in accidents. The insurer will usually pay a portion of the sum insured for a pre-defined period in such a case.
6. Dependent Child education benefit
Get child education benefits for your dependent child(ren) with Bajaj Finance as an optional cover with your policy. This partner insurer offers this coverage to help continue the education of the policyholder's child(ren). The insurer provides a sum for the children's education if the policyholder suffers permanent total disability or death. Education fund benefit is available for up to two children.
What is not covered in a personal accident insurance policy
Personal accident insurance commonly excludes death due to natural causes, accidents that occur under the influence of alcohol or drugs, adventure sports and hazardous activities or suicide.
Also, such insurance plans don't cover death or injuries during pregnancy, including childbirth, abortion, miscarriage, or while participating in naval, military or air force operations, or HIV and other related ailments.
Having an accident insurance policy in one's insurance portfolio is a must. By opting for (https://www.bajajfinserv.in/health-insurance-personal-accident-covers) personal accident insurance by Bajaj Finance, one can stay financially equipped during medical emergencies.

Shares of HDFC Asset Management Company (AMC), HDFC Life Insurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company and SBI Life Insurance Company were among 22 stocks from the S&P BSE 500 index hitting their respective all-time highs on the BSE on Tuesday.
Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Nestle India, Bata India, Berger Paints, Info Edge (India), Manappuram Finance, Siemens, Voltas and Whirlpool of India, too, hit new highs today.
Of theses, HDFC AMC, Manappuram Finance and Bata India have seen their market value more-than-doubled in the past one year. Berger Paints India, Fine Organic Industries, Siemens, SBI Life Insurance, HDFC Life Insurance, Info Edge (India), Blue Star and ICICI Lombard were up in the range of 60 per cent to 100 per cent. In comparison, the S&P BSE Sensex was up 15 per cent during the period.
Among the individual stocks, HDFC AMC has been the top gainer, up 7 per cent to Rs 3,073 on the BSE. The stock surpassed its previous high of Rs 2,975,touched on September 23, 2019. It rallied 128 per cent from the level of Rs 1,348. The share price of the company zoomed 179 per cent against its issue price of Rs 1,100 per share.
According to analysts at Nirmal Bang Securities, Indian AMC sector is another attractive platform to play the Indian financials theme since it stands to capture, and benefit from the migration of household savings and wealth from physical assets and traditional bank deposits to mutual funds.
Increasing monthly SIP run rate leads us to believe that rising individual participation is a structural trend. We expect that a significant part of business from this opportunity will accrue to the top 5 players in the industry, the brokerage firm said in sector update. However, the stock of HDFC AMC was trading above its target price of Rs 2,724 per share.
Analysts at JP Morgan remain confident on India life insurers’ strong new business value (NBV) growth outlook in the next 10 years given the low penetration.
That said, moving into 2Q20, we expect near-term softening in NBV growth rate as premium growth starts to moderate. We forecast 15-38 per cent YoY Q220 NBV growth potential for top three private life insurers. For the non-life sector, we would see relatively smaller underwriting improvement potential in the next couple of months due to competitive pricing in the motor own damage (OD) and lower auto sales volume.
The motor third party (TP) pricing hike and scale increase would be a source of mitigation for private players. In short, ""we expect the sector’s price momentum will likely moderate in the near-term and we recommend to add quality names in any weakness during Q2 reporting season,"" the foreign brokerage firm said in sector update.
HUL was trading higher for the ninth straight day. The counter hit a new high of Rs 2,148 on Tuesday, gaining 11 per cent during the period. The fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company reported better-than-expected Q2FY20 results.
HUL’s net profit grew 21 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 1,840 crore, while sales revenue rose 6 per cent YoY at Rs 9,708 crore relative to the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin, too, expanded 293 basis points (bps) YoY to 24.8 per cent in Q2FY20. Benign input cost, improved product-mix, cost-saving initiatives, lower employee cost and higher operating leverage contributed to better operating performance despite higher advertising expenses.

Not surprisingly, SBI Mutual Fund, the biggest public money manager, is now selling those PSU stocks that it had accumulated over the last one year.
The buy-sell data for June showed SBI MF sold 2.75 crore shares of oil explorer Oil & Natural Gas Corporation, 1.56 crore shares of SAIL and over 57 lakh shares of Bharat Electronics.
The fund house also dumped 10-50 lakh shares of Vodafone Idea, HPCL, Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance, ITC, Cummins India, Emami, Motherson Sumi Systems, DLF, Ambuja Cements, Firstsource Solutions and Housing & Urban Development Corporation. BPCL, IndianOil and NMDC are the other PSU stocks that featured in this list.
When reached out, SBI Mutual Fund didn’t immediately reply to queries on this selloff.
Some analysts believe it is better to stay away from PSU stocks now, especially since better businesses are available in the same sectors.
“We have a choice in many sectors, where you have PSU names plus some very robust private sector names. Yes, there is a valuation difference, and obviously, the PSU sector does offer very cheap valuation, but clearly the way the businesses are run is rather different. For some time, we have kept away from the PSU space and I am not sure I have seen enough yet to entice me back,” said Jonathan Schiessl, an emerging market expert, who was earlier with IIFL.
However, SBI MF has not shunned all PSU names. It is still bought select names from the power sector, as India broke all records of electricity consumption this calendar.
Fund managers bought 3.14 crore shares of NHPC and nearly 62 lakh shares of PowerGrid. It also added Bank of Baroda and Concor, two of the government’s disinvestment candidates.
Besides, it bought 20 lakh to 1 crore shares of Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, V-Guard Industries, Tata Steel, TVS Motor, UPL, Muthoot Finance, Ashok Leyland, Equitas Holdings and Axis Bank.
“Yet at a time when our in-house equity market sentiment measure suggests overheated condition, which to us has been a key tactical risk, taper fears can potentially bring about volatility. This could be especially pronounced in pockets with speculative excesses,” SBI MF said in a recent note.
“We would, however, recommend using any correction to add good quality pro-cyclical assets and stocks to position for the next several years of likely uptick in economic activity and corporate earnings in India,” it said.
Meanwhile, the fund house took fresh positions in Avanti Feeds, Brigade Enterprises, Dodla Dairy, India Pesticides, Indian Bank, KNR Constructions, Manappuram Finance and Sona BLW Precision Forgings. Three of them are last month’s debutants.
At the same time, the fund house exited Barbeque-Nation Hospitality and JSW Energy.
SBI Mutual Fund is the top fund house in India with assets under management (AUM) at Rs 5.24 lakh crore, widening the gap against the rest. ICICI Pru AMC stands at the second spot with an AUM at Rs 4.29 lakh crore and HDFC AMC third with Rs 4.18 lakh crore.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Schaeffler India price can reach the defined target.
Investment rationale by JM Financial
Tractors, CVs and railways to drive sales growth: Sales growth momentum picked up towards end-CY17 and is likely to sustain in CY18 an improvement in rural income (tractors/2Ws), higher infra spends (CVs) by the government and increased budgetary allocation to transportation (railways, construction, etc.). Exports have dropped from a high base and are likely to sustain moderate growth in CY18.
Key takeaways from AGM: Schaeffler India is looking at more than doubling its capex to Rs 4bn/annum for the combined entity (50 per cent of this would pertain to Schaeffler standalone) as it aims to increase localisation levels (72 per cent currently) and achieve faster growth. Rising input costs have been countered through a 4 per cent price hike across the board on 1 April 2018 and should reflect in coming months.
1QCY18: In-line growth; sales mix worsens: 1QCY18 results were largely in line with our estimates as sales grew 13 per cent YoY and net profit grew 15 per cent. However, an adverse sales mix restricted EBITDA growth to 5 per cent YoY as exports declined 3 per cent vs. 16 per cent growth in the domestic business.
CY17 annual report takeaways: As per the annual report, key focus areas for CY18 are the merger of group entities, a ramp-up in capacity and cost reduction. Traded goods saw a sharp jump in margins (25 per cent vs. 18.5 per cent) due to lower sourcing costs. The company's cash balance continued to rise (50 per cent of capital employed) and hurt return ratios, but aggressive capex over CY18-20 will effectively utilise the excess cash on its books.
Maintain BUY with target price of Rs 6,000: We continue to maintain our BUY call and forecast 18 per cent earnings CAGR over CY17-19E as we expect healthy growth in the company's domestic segments. We maintain BUY with a target price of Rs 6,000, implying 30x CY19E EPS.

It added 1.59 crore shares of Bharat Electronics whose share price has rallied nearly 25 per cent so far this calendar. BSE benchmark Sensex is up just 2.46 per cent year to date.
“Indian equities are offering good value,” Prashant Jain, ED & CIO of HDFC Asset Management, told ETNow. “When largecaps start offering good value, you are unlikely to get it wrong, because these are big businesses with low leverage. Corporate leverage in India has come down,” he said.
Ace Mutual Fund database showed HDFC AMC held 6.02 crore shares of YES Bank as of August 31 against 2.57 crore a month earlier, hinting that the fund house sees value in the private sector lender.
“Most of the businesses, which were in deep pain have either been sold or are in a state where they do not really matter. They are doing reasonably well and things are okay,” he said.
Reliance Industries.
HDFC AMC also added shares of banking majors ICICI Bank (30 lakh shares), Axis Bank (21.67 lakh) and HDFC Bank (17.51 lakh) besides doing a fair bit of buying on the counters of DCB Bank (16.61 lakh), RBL Bank (7.50 lakh) and Federal Bank (7.59 lakh).
Saravana Kumar, CIO, Essel Mutual Fund, says retail-focused private lenders with strong balance sheets should do well going forward. “These banks will also corner some market shares from NBFCs and PSUs,” he said.
Jain’s team at HDFC Mutual Fund also bought over 10 lakh shares each in Avenue Supermarts, Tata Steel, Delta Corp, BPCL, Bajaj Electricals and Indian Hotels.
Inox Fluorochemicals, Pidilite Industries, Piramal Enterprises, SRF and Sterling and Wilson were among the fund house’s fresh buys, while it completely exited Havells India and Shree Cement.
Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 122 companies and offloaded shares of 33 across sectors. It held 314 stocks as of August 31, 2019.
Among the stocks in which the fund house offloaded between 1 lakh to 2.50 crore shares during the month were BHEL, SAIL, Reliance Nippon Life Asset, NIIT Technologies, Tata Chemicals, Shriram Transport Finance, Just Dial, Bharti Airtel, Ambuja Cement, Elecon Engineering, Zee Entertainment, Rites, Wonderla Holidays, Solar Industries, S Chand and IndiaMART InterMESH.
It also sold more than 1 lakh shares of auto majors including Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp. India this August recorded the steepest drop in auto sales ever since the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) had started collating monthly wholesale vehicle sales data in 1997-98.
Jain of HDFC Asset Management said he sold auto stocks mainly due to valuations. “The prices have come down, but multiples have not come down because earnings will also de-grow sharply. First investment has to revive, salaries have to go up and only then can we make a case for a sustained revival in consumer discretionary,” he said.

Morgan Stanley on Paytm: Equal-Weight | Target Rs 695
Morgan Stanley maintained an equal-weight rating on Paytm with a target price of Rs 695. “For Paytm Payments Bank, new guidelines could lead to additional revenues,” the investment bank stated.
“One97 Communications (OCL) should benefit as interchanged fees paid to Paytm Payments Bank move lower,” it added.
However, it said that it awaits clarity from management on net positive impact.
Jefferies on Ambuja Cements: Buy | Target Rs 490
UBS on Indian Hotels: Buy | Target Rs 400
UBS maintained a buy rating on Indian Hotels with a target price of Rs 400.
The global investment bank hosted Indian hotel management wherein Indian Hotels said that the management sees no signs of momentum slowing down.
“Traditionally Q3 is seasonally better for India. India's hospitality story remains strong, even in Q4,” said the note.
JM Financial on PI Industries: Buy| Target Rs 3575
JM Financial maintained a buy rating on PI industries with a target price of Rs 3575. Investors have become cautious against earnings wonders created by one product, as seen in the case of Divi’s and Laurus.
PI’s dependence on pyroxasulfone is, thus, increasingly under the spotlight. “However, we think the comparison is misplaced,” said the note.
“We believe that the sun has not yet set on PI’s pyroxasulfone given i) PI’s pyroxasulfone is a case of structural growth whereas Divi’s and Laurus’ molecules were opportunistic, and ii) pyroxasulfone’s usage is rising due to its effectiveness,” the note added.
“We believe PI has enough ammunition to tackle the peak of pyroxasulfone and is unlikely to suffer the same fate as Divi’s and Laurus. We had earlier indicated (click here and here) how PI could deliver its 18-20% promised growth rate. We estimate an EPS CAGR of 17% over FY23-25E and maintain BUY with a Mar’24 target of Rs 3,575/share,” recommended the brokerage firm.

You are managing billions of dollars. How can one invest in Saurabh Mukherjea now? I want to invest in Marcellus. How can that happen?
That is all long talk. Tell me the reason. You are a smart stock picker. How can one invest in Saurabh Mukherjea?
The Marcellus stock, for better or worse, is not for sale at the moment. Five-six years out, maybe Marcellus stock would be available to the world at large. At the moment it is owned by the employees by and large. Jokes apart, whilst the employees own the company, without the Indian investors faith in the country. Remember we have been through three traumatic years, two years of Covid, now all this drama around Ukraine but what is remarkable is the unrelenting faith of the Indian investor in the country itself. FPIs come and go. The local investors stand strong and that has allowed us to build a business where maybe we are able to run a company with 120 people managing Rs 13,000 crore. All of that would not have been happening if the local public in India had not believed in the country’s economy.
Have you got fresh inflows in this market volatility? The mutual fund folks are getting flows. Have you got fresh inflows when markets fell in March?
We were getting around Rs 100 crore a week for most of the last couple of years. When the war with Ukraine broke out, for a couple of weeks it reduced to Rs 50-60 crore a week; but over the last 10 days or so, we are back to the usual Marcellus number of around Rs 100 crore a week coming in.
Samir Arora gave a very interesting data point. His data point was that in the last couple of years, the profits for consumer companies have doubled but the prices have tripled – a PE expansion has happened. Now for the first time there is a demand impact and there is a margin impact. So he is making a case that the PE multiples have to contract purely because of the expansion which has happened in the past which has been higher than the earning expansion.
I think the first thing to realise is what drives stock prices is not earnings. What drives stock prices is free cash flows. If you take the typical company that we invest in, whether it is in our Little Champs portfolios which we opened for inflows last week after two years or in our flagship Consistent Compounders portfolio, whether it is in our smallcaps or in our largecap portfolio, what we have seen over the last five years is that profit compounding in India in well run companies tends to be between 15% and 20%.
So if it is a larger company like Asian Paints, Pidilite, the profit compounding is around 15% and if it is a smaller company like say Alkyl Amines or GMM Pfaudler, profit compounding will be around 20%. But frees cash flow compounding is the real driver of share prices. Whether it is an Asian Paints or a Pidilite, large companies’ free cash flows are compounding at 25% even through the last three-four-five years. In the smaller stocks, the Little Champs franchises – as we call them – the free cash flow compounding is around 35%. So this difference is big.
If a company as big as Asian Paints or a Pidilite compounds profits at 15% but cash flows at 25%, it is the cash flow compounding which is driving the stock. Optically the PE multiple will look high because the P is not following E. The P is following free cash flow. I will give you an extreme example. Over the last 10 years, Astral Poly profits are up 5X, free cash flows up 100X, share prices up 100X. We have spent a lot of time explaining this to people that what drives share prices is not profits, Astral Poly’s profits are up 5X in 10 years, free cash flows are up 100X. You need to follow the cash not the PAT and you will make good money in India even though the current fiscal that is going to end today, free cash flows are up very strongly for almost all our investee companies.
In recent times what is it that you bought in the crash? You told us earlier that you accumulated more of Asian Paints and Pidilite but what else?
I might have mentioned before that we have also bought plenty of Dr Lal. We could not make any logical sense of the share price pullback. As we just discussed, PE multiples do not drive share prices and so we bought plenty of Dr Lal over the last couple of months. Our smallcap portfolio is one area where we have to hold our hand up and say we did not quite get it right over the last three years. We in fact told on this programme that auto and auto ancillary would do well. They have not done well and hence over the last couple of months, we have held back from our auto and auto ancillary investments.
A lot of that money has gone in the smallcap portfolio and to Vmart . We have been holding Vmart for two years. Shares have not done much over the last 12 months even but as the unlock proceeds, given the quality of Vmart’s franchise, given the way the retailer has crushed working capital, if you look at Indian retail barring Trent that is Westside, we do not see anybody else managing the apparel business as well as Vmart does. So we have loaded up further in Vmart as we have reduced our auto and auto ancillary investments.
In our larger cap portfolios, we bought more of ICICI Lombard in our flagship portfolio Consistent Compounder. So those have been the two areas where we bought two franchises which we had investments in the past but we have ramped them up over the last couple of months quite aggressively – Vmart and ICICI Lombard.
Axis, a new franchise is buying out Citibank’s consumer business. Axis is looking at M&As to plug holes in its franchise. It has done with Max Life, now it is doing with Citi. What do you make of it?
We have Axis in our Kings of Capital Portfolio. Kings of Capital is our financials only portfolios and we have had it for around two years. Obviously we have had some push back from clients over the last couple of years as Axis has not had the greatest of runs but we persevered partly because we have seen Amitabh build a great franchise at HDFC Life. We also persevered because we have done ground level checks right throughout Covid on Axis’s branch networks, on the people who have been joining the firm, the new people that Amitabh has bought in.
Our view has been that this man is turning around the Axis franchise, he is bringing in good people, he is putting operational rigour. Given that they had spare capital, given Amitabh’s track record, we banked that he will deliver and we are happy to see the deal. We are happy to see the Citibank deal. It will take them two-three years to actually show us the fruits of that deal in terms of better ROEs. But given that they have surplus capital, they seem to have acquired a profitable franchise. We think it is the right deal to do.
We are also quite keen to see more happening on that Axis-Max front where nobody knows banca and the power of banca, selling insurance through the branch networks of a high quality private sector bank. We do not think anybody understands that better than Amitabh and so we are keen to see more happening on the Axis and Max front.
Overall, given how few high quality private sector banks are there in our country, one can count them on the fingers of one hand. In fact we do not even need the fingers of one hand to count high quality private sector banks. We think this is a space in which a strong player like Axis with CASA ratios now approaching 45-47% will do very well in this incipient economic recovery.
What are the hidden gems in your portfolio? Anything of late?
We have already discussed Paushak. We continue building that position. It is a controlled market. Barriers to entry are high. Whilst a couple of other larger companies do make phosgene in India, our reckoning is their capacity constraints in phosgene are considerable and therefore this is your only pure play private sector phosgene manufacturer.
Phosgene is as essential an industrial chemical as chlorine. It is hazardous but at the same time it is essential and therefore we reckon Paushak has been able to make money. We are looking for more smallcap ideas but I will be honest it takes lots of hard work and one-one and a half years of research to nail down a stock which one can invest in.
We are going to be very careful about these investments. In a given year, you will see us making one or two small cap investments and perhaps getting out of one or two strong cap stocks. So Vmart has been a little champ for us, Paushak is now a little champ for us. It is hard to find smallcap ideas with metronomic regularity. We will try our best.
Since you are talking about your little camps I want to know which are the little champs in the last two years V-Mart of course is one that you talked about but which are the other big candidates which really made you those big moneys in the last two years?
So I think as we have discussed I think repeatedly on your channel over the last couple of years I think Alkyl Amines and GMM Pfaudler we first bought it actually first invested in them three years ago but over the last couple of years they have made our clients lot of money. In fact if I look at our little champ’s portfolio in its entirety in two and a half years we have more than doubled client’s money and significant role was played by Alkyl Amines and GMM Pfaudler more recently a company that we invested in two years ago Fine organics is coming through very nicely. We also have high hopes of Galaxy Surfactants and if I look at the financial space Aavas Financiers we think is a lender that can make money for us, they have done well but I think the real upswing in Aavas given that they are well capitalised, well run, and the real upswing in Aavas will come in now that the unlock has happened and the economy has started recovering but I think prior to place in terms of creating wealth for Marcellus’s client should go to Alkyl Amines and GMM Pfaudler.
If Asian Paints and Pidilite are your largecap champion compounders, GMM Pfaudler and Alkyl Amines are in that category, which are these long-term compounders?
The main difference, leaving aside the obvious difference in market cap, where the GMMs and the Alkyl are one-tenth the market cap of a Pidilite or an Asian Paints, leaving aside that obvious difference, the main difference tends to be the institutionalisation of the franchise since smaller companies like GMM, like Alkyl, like Paushak, like Fine Organics the dependence on the promoters is greater, whereas in larger franchises like Asian Paints or TCS, it is far more institutionalised where the family has taken a back seat and high quality managers typically people hired from the IITs and IIMs, when they are in their early 20s and then they grow to run the business that institutionalisation is far more advanced in our flagship investments in consistent compounders.
One of the things we work on quite closely with our smallcap investments is nudging them, prodding them, guiding them to institutionalise the business and encouraging the promoter to play the role of a capital allocator and handing over the day-to-day management of the business to high quality managers. It is not easy to do, these people are hard to find plus it is hard for promoters to let go. But institutionalisation is the fundamental difference between our little champs versus our consistent compounders.

“Trading Members of the Exchange are hereby informed that effective from Monday, August 21, 2023, the equity shares of Jio Financial Services Ltd (formerly known as Reliance Strategic Investments Limited) shall be listed and admitted to dealings on the Exchange in the list of T Group of Securities,” the BSE said on Friday.
The scrip, to be traded under symbol JIOFIN, will be in the Trade-for-Trade (T2T) segment for 10 days, it said. In the T2T segment, only delivery trades are permitted, unlike intra-day trading where buying and selling takes place on the same day without taking delivery.
Intra-day trading is not allowed in the T2T segment.
The shares of JFSL were credited to the demat accounts of RIL shareholders last week
in the ratio of 1:1.
Last month, JFSL became the second largest non-banking finance company (NBFC) in terms of market capitalisation as it was valued at $20 billion after a special pre-open market session.
The session was held to discover its share price which came in at Rs 261.85 apiece.
This took its implied market value to Rs 1.6 lakh crore given its outstanding shares estimated at 620 crore.
At this valuation, it is now the second-largest NBFC in India and the 32nd most valued company, bigger than giants such as Tata Steel, Coal India and Indian Oil.
Bajaj Finance is the biggest NBFC with a market cap of Rs 4.15 lakh crore and JFSL will be second to it ahead of Bajaj Holdings, SBI Cards, Shriram Finance, Muthoot Finance and Paytm.
The much-anticipated listing date comes at a time index managers were growing concerned about the delay.
UK’s FTSE Russell on Thursday decided to remove JFSL from its indexes due to the delay, but reversed the decision on Friday after the listing date was announced.
According to brokerage BofA Securities, by separating financial services

In October, so far, also they have continued to sell equities.
In September, outflow was at Rs 2,595.70 crore as compared to Rs 9,339.02 crore in August, Rs 7,231.99 crore in July and Rs 3,689.67 crore in June, as per the Sebi data.

Among specific categories within equity schemes, multi-cap scheme witnessed the highest outflow of Rs 1,143 crore, followed by large-cap funds at Rs 576 crore.
The rally seen in equity market in past few months and change in Sebi rules for multi-cap funds could be the reasons behind the outflow, experts feel.
Sebi, on September 11, had issued a circular which mandated multi-cap funds to allocate at least 25 percent of their portfolios to each of large-, mid- and smallcaps by February 2021.
In September, the highest buying by asset management companies was seen in Adani Green Energy, Piramal Enterprises, Godrej Consumer Products, Bosch and Tech Mahindra, whereas Bharti Infratel, HDFC AMC, Punjab National Bank, SBI Cards And Payment Services and MRF witnessed highest selling, ICICI Direct said.

Shriram Transport Finance Company was in the top 10 buying list of MFs in August, while Syngene International and Vodafone Idea remained in the top 10 selling list in August too.
In the smallcap space, the highest buying by AUMs was seen in Shilpa Medicare, Essel Propack, Valiant Organics, GMM Pfaudler and BSE Limited, whereas Future Lifestyle Fashions, Aarti Drugs, Mahindra CIE Automotive, IndiaMART InterMESH and Laurus Labs witnessed highest selling.
Aarti Drugs was also in the top 10 selling list in August, while GMM Pfaudler was at the 8th spot in selling list in August.
Meanwhile, the SIP inflows remained strong in September at Rs 7,788 crore, compared to Rs 7,792 crore in August. In fact, it has been strong despite past months outflow in MFs.
""Regular investing through SIP route has remained robust. This is demonstrated by the healthy growth in number of SIP folios as well as by the monthly flows which seems to have stabilized,"" G Pradeepkumar CEO at Union AMC told Moneycontrol.
""It appears interest in equity mutual fund schemes is seeing a good revival. Mobilisation into open ended equity schemes in September has been the highest in the current financial year. The number of folios in the industry as a whole and specifically in equity funds has also gone up significantly,"" he said.
Akhil Chaturvedi-Associate Director and Head of Sales and Distribution, Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company also feels it is encouraging to see the equity numbers improving in September as compared to August.
""Better sales numbers in equity MF could also be a function of markets recovering back to Pre-COVID Levels, early signs of an impending economic recovery thus leading to increase in investors’ appetite for equities,"" he said.
Overall, net AUM of the mutual fund industry fell to Rs 26.85 lakh crore in September from Rs 27.49 lakh crore a month ago.

IndiaMART InterMESH, KEC International, Suryoday Small Finance Bank, JK Tyre and Industries, Ircon International, Engineers India, Satin Creditcare, Future Consumer, Vadilal Industries, and Rail Vikas Nigam are among the smallcap stocks that gained 11-32% in the week gone by.
Rail-related companies were back in demand as outlook for growth in FY24 remains following a stellar show in FY23. The Indian Railways’ gross revenue in FY23 rose 28% on year to Rs 2.44 lakh crore. Railways reported a nearly 7% growth in freight loading.
Rail Vikas Nigam was the top gainer among smallcap stocks with 32% weekly gains. The stellar upmove was on the back of major orders that the company won which improved the revenue visibility.
Gains in shares of InterMART InterMESH were aided by the quarter earnings reported by the company. The company reported an over 33% growth in revenue both for the March quarter and for FY23.
Brokerage JM Financial Institutional Securities has retained “buy” rating on the stock and raised its price target by 16% to Rs 5,900 on strong visibility.
“While valuations at 40x/32x FY25/26E PER are no doubt punchy, we expect the stock to still trade at a premium amidst strong earnings visibility,” the brokerage said.
KEC International stock, which clocked 13% gains last week, was also driven by the strong outlook for earnings growth in FY24. The company reported an over 29% rise in revenue in the March quarter, but profit dropped by 36% due to the pressure on profitability.
However, the company saw a 30% rise in order inflows in FY23 and it expects orders to remain healthy in FY24 as well.
“We remain positive on KEC for the long-term given its strong order book, healthy execution momentum, strong T&D business outlook, and revenue visibility for non-T&D segments like civil, railways, oil & gas etc,” brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said in its report.
The stock is trading at 24.6x its one-year forward P/E, and the brokerage has retained “accumulate” rating while raising the price target to Rs 559 from Rs 505 earlier.
Similarly, better earnings from M&M Financial Services aided gains in the stock. Year-to-date, the stock has given more than 22% returns to investors.
According to JM Financial analysts, M&M Financial’s stock price has been rewarded with the management’s reinvigorated focus on key profitability and asset quality parameters.
So, incremental returns will be driven by predictability of earnings and continued delivery of its stated objectives.
“We like the management’s categorical stance on focusing on risk parameters and expect gradual delivery to drive incremental returns,” JM Financial analyst Sameer Bhise said in his report.
The analyst has retained a “buy” rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 310.

Most NBFCs had a decent quarter amid a challenging environment as they reported steady net interest margins (NIMs) despite an increase in borrowing costs.
""A lot of pieces are falling in place for NBFCs. Stronger liability profile supported by more diversified, granular and longer duration bank borrowings, deposits and securitisation along with the lower cost of borrowing and normalisation of credit spreads, and a significant improvement in overall system liquidity will aid in a return of confidence to the sector,"" said JM Financial in a report on December 2.
With lower valuations, JM Financial believes the sector is attractively placed in the context of improving liquidity conditions, lower funding costs and lower credit spreads going ahead.
""Large retail finance NBFCs with strong promoter backing and well-managed ALM should do well going ahead. Consolidation or strategy recalibration among developer financiers will lead to higher market share and improved profitability for players like HDFC,"" said JM Financial.
Here are five stocks from the sector that, as per brokerages, can deliver healthy returns in a one-year timeframe.
Expert: Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services
M&M Financial Services | Buy | Target price: Rs 412
The analyst believes that an extensive branch network, diversified product portfolio, coupled with strong business tie-ups with OEM’s and a strong parentage will help the company. Despite the liquidity crunch in the NBFC sector as a whole, the company maintained positive liquidity gaps in all the buckets.
LIC Housing Finance | Accumulate | Target price: Rs 495
""We remain positive on LIC Housing Finance given the company’s extensive distribution network, strong brand value and reduction in competition from NBFCs in the housing finance space,"" Nair said. Stable NIMs and reduction in the cost of funds expected with NCDs at higher cost getting refinanced in H2FY20. The analyst values the stock at 1.2 times FY21E BVPS with a target price of Rs 495.
Can Fin Homes | Accumulate | Target price: Rs 432
Robust loan growth outlook with an increasing customer base, expansion of branches in tier 3 cities along with stable asset quality are expected to support the company’s overall margins and growth in the coming years. ""We value the stock at 2.4 times FY21E BVPS with a target price of Rs 432,"" said Nair.
Brokerage: Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers
Bajaj Finance | Buy | Target price: Rs 4,818
Bajaj Finance is one of the largest players in the rapidly growing consumer finance segment in India and a pioneer in introducing interest-free EMI finance options in more than 50 categories, ranging from consumer durables to lifestyle products to groceries.
Apart from consumer finance, the company also has substantial business penetration in SME, commercial and rural lending. With housing as a subsidiary, mortgages are also gaining traction.
The company offers a wide range of products to its customers through multiple segments which includes products such as consumer durable loans, digital product loans, lifestyle product loans, two-wheeler & three-wheeler loans, salaried personal loans, e-commerce consumer finance, working capital loans, loan to professionals, commercial loans, gold loans, home loans etc.
A well-diversified credit portfolio, focus on cross-selling, customer acquisition, systematic expansion in delivery channels both physical and virtual, and distribution of products through these channels are likely to sustain robust growth in AUM going forward.
HDFC | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,539
HDFC is the leading provider of Housing Finance in India with a gross loan book of Rs 4 lakh crore and about 19 lakh deposits accounts.
The company reported consolidated revenues of Rs 32,796.5 crore in Q2FY20, registering a growth of 43.2 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.
The company witnessed growth in its businesses including life insurance and general insurance.
Management continues to see demand in the individual segments, particularly from the affordable housing segment. It also noted
that the company will continue to remain cautious about the non-individual loan portfolio.
""We believe HDFC will continue to benefit from its strong market position, continued growth in loans, healthy asset quality and stable spreads. In terms of macro scenario, the domestic mortgage has plenty of upside with low penetration levels. Also, favorable government policies and initiatives focused on affordable housing create impetus in the housing sector,"" said the brokerage.

HDFC Ltd is the first specialised housing finance company (HFC) and also the largest with an outstanding loan book of Rs 312978 crore. The conglomerate has a presence and superior position in growing financial business segments like insurance, both life and general, asset management and banking apart from its own core housing loan leadership business.
Outlook
HDFC has commanded premium valuations over the years due to its consistent track record in earnings. Return ratios have remained healthy across economic cycles with RoE >20% & RoA ~2.2-2.3%. We expect PAT CAGR of ~11.9% in FY17-19E and loan CAGR of 16.2%. We value the standalone business at 3.5x ABV. Based on recent life insurance IPOs at 3.8-4.2x tailing EV, we upgrade HDFC life valuation to 3.6x forward EV (4.2x trailing). IPOs expected in asset management industry, lead to revised valuations for HDFC AMC business to 8% of AUM from 6% earlier. We revise our SOTP based target price higher to Rs 2056/share from Rs 1950. We reiterate our BUY recommendation on the stock.

Keppel Land has already signed the term sheet to acquire nearly 1 million sq ft of commercial real estate spread across a total six entire floors in this multi-tenanted tower. The transaction will exclude nearly 2 lakh sq ft office space occupied by Piramal enterprises.
“The transaction is nearing conclusion as most of the processes have been completed and a final agreement will be signed in the next few weeks,” said one of the persons mentioned above.
Piramal Agastya, spread over 16 acres on LBS Marg, is one of the country’s largest non-information technology (IT) commercial developments, with a total project size of nearly 2 million sq ft.
Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, Piramal Enterprises, French sports goods retailer Decathlon, Metropolitan Stock Exchange and Axis Securities are among the key existing office occupiers here.
Goldman Sachs and Warburg Pincus among its investors. Goldman Sachs and Warburg Pincus, two international equity partners, have invested about $434 million in Piramal Realty at the entity level, which is the largest private equity commitment to an Indian real estate company at the company level.
Keppel Land is geographically diversified in Asia, with Singapore, China and Vietnam as its key markets, while it continues to scale up in other markets including India and Indonesia.
In India, the company has entered into an alliance with Rustomjee Group to build an integrated township in Thane near Mumbai. Separately, Keppel Land has also entered into a joint venture with Emerald Haven Realty, a TVS Group company, to develop a freehold condominium project on a nearly 6-acre land parcel in South Chennai.
The new deal between Keppel Land and Piramal Realty reinforces continued interest of global institutional investors including private equity, sovereign funds and insurance companies in Indian commercial real estate on the back of rapid urbanisation, favourable regulatory norms and high demand for residential and office premises across the country.
The appetite for Indian realty among global institutional investors continues to be strong as indicated by major foreign funds like Blackstone Group, Brookfield Asset Management, GIC, Xander, Ascendas, CPPIB, Warburg Pincus and Goldman Sachs that are expanding their investments into the sector.
Private equity investments into the real estate sector have continued to rise over the last few years and even the last two years despite the pandemic scenario. The surge is mostly driven by foreign funds investing in India as the real estate recovery is now fully visible and the structural long-term changes are fructifying.
Both global and domestic institutional investors continue to eye a number of investment opportunities across residential, mixed-use, commercial, retail, industrial and other real estate segments in India.

Outlook for March 28
Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares
Diverging from their weak counterparts, Indian equities started the session on a strong note and compounded their gains under the leadership of select heavyweights; however, towards the end of the day, the Index pared off some of its gains to settle the day at 22,123.65 with gains of 118.95 points. Realty and Energy were the top performers on a sector-wise performance while PSU Banks and IT were the laggards.
A mixed trend was seen in the broader markets where Midcaps underperformed while Smallcap gained over 0.90% and outshined Nifty50. As indicated yesterday, the Index has formed an Inverted Head & Shoulder formation and now awaiting a breakout for the target of 22,640 while on the lower side, 21,900 will continue to act as a strong support.
Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas
The Nifty opened gap up and continued to inch higher throughout the day to close with gains of ~119 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty is inching towards 22200 – 22215 where multiple resistance parameters are placed. We believe that the retracement rally has more steam left and we expect the momentum to continue. Daily and hourly momentum indicator is providing divergent signals which can lead to a consolidation and hence in case of a dip towards 22100 – 22060 it should be used as a buying opportunity for target of 22215 - 22250.
Bank Nifty is consolidating within the range of 46500 – 47000 since last four trading sessions. A breach of this range shall lead to trending moves in that direction. We expect it to break out on the upside and expect levels of 47270 – 47300 from short term perspective and hence one can go long with a stoploss of 46530.

The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price.
March quarter highlights:
Can Fin’s fresh approvals and disbursements jumped 17-18 per cent at quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis in Q4FY19, supported by ample liquidity, positive movement in the domestic market of Karnataka and improved business traction in new branches.
Despite an increase in portfolio run-off (annualized rate 17 per cent against 16 per cent in Q3FY19), the loan book grew by a healthy 5 per cent QoQ and 17 per cent year-on-year (YoY).
Housing Loans (90 per cent of loan book) portfolio grew by 16 per cent YoY (marking continued deceleration), and within this the self-employed portfolio grew two times of salaried home loan portfolio.
markets in fresh approvals and loan book has risen to 40 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively.
Overall cost of funds was stable in Q4FY19, with incremental funding cost being marginally lower than Q3FY19. The reliance on bank borrowings and NHB re-financing has been increasing. While loans from banks are coming at MCLR, the borrowing rate from NHB is much lower on blended basis.
Investment thesis:
""We expect Can Fin to deliver 18-20 per cent pa loan assets growth over FY19-21,"" the brokerage said.
Earnings should compound at similar rate even as credit cost normalizes, due to some improvement in the NIM, the brokerage added.
The company is estimated to deliver average RoA and RoE of over 1.7 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively over the aforesaid period.
Can Fin deserves a relatively high multiple among the HFCs considering its demonstrated resilience during material economic and liquidity events.
The strength of the franchise stems from its portfolio granularity and tight underwriting.

Author: Dipankar Datta
Bench: Debi Prosad Dey, Dipankar Datta
IN THE HIGH COURT AT CALCUTTA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION APPELLATE SIDE PRESENT : Hon'ble Justice Dipankar Datta and Hon'ble Justice Debi Prosad Dey CAN 1559 of 2017 in FMAT 165 of 2017 Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Echhlam Molla & ors.. with COT 33 of 2017 Echhlam Molla & ors. v. The Cholamandalam Ms General Insurance Co. Limited & anr. For the appellant/respondent Mr. Rajesh Singh no.1 in the cross objection For the respondent no.1/cross Mr. J.K. Mondal, objector Ms. Sima Ghosh. Heard on : May 16, 2017 Judgment on : June 14, 2017 1. While riding pillion on a motor-bike, Anowar Molla (hereafter the victim) died in a road accident on September 25, 2011. The motor-bike was dashed from behind by a lorry bearing registration no. WB 41D-6060, which was being driven rashly and negligently by its driver, as a result whereof the victim suffered multiple injuries and succumbed thereto at the local hospital. The parents of the victim and his siblings approached the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Diamond Harbour, 24-Parganas (South) on May 2, 2014 with an application under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereafter the Act). Upon hearing the parties and on consideration of the evidence that were led, the tribunal awarded compensation in a sum of Rs.6,16,500/- to be payable to the claimants by the insurer of the lorry together with simple interest @ 6% per annum from the date of filing of the application within 30 days, failing which interest @ 9% per annum would have to be paid. 2. Quantification of compensation payable to the claimants is under challenge both at the instance of the insurer as well as the claimants, in the appeal and the cross-objection respectively. 3. While hearing the application for stay filed in the appeal, we have heard the parties on the merits of the appeal as well as the cross-objection dispensing with all formalities and with their consent and propose to dispose of the same by this common judgment and order. 4. Mr. Singh learned advocate for the appellant/insurer confined his arguments to the following points:- i) Since the victim was self-employed, the tribunal erred in considering 'future prospects' while determining compensation; ii) Assuming that some amount of compensation could be awarded under the head 'future prospects', the tribunal made a mess by adding 100% of the notional income of the victim towards such future prospects; and iii) Having awarded simple interest @ 6%, the tribunal erred in law by observing that failure to pay interest @ 6% on the awarded sum within the stipulated date would result in the insurer being liable to pay higher interest @ 9%. 5. Mr. Mondal, learned advocate for the cross-objectors/claimants contended that the tribunal erred in determining compensation by treating Rs.3000/- to be the monthly income of the victim. According to him, no reason was assigned by the tribunal as to how Rs.10000/-, as stated by the claimant no.1 to be the income that the victim earned from his business of mobile phones and accessories, was not believable. Next, he urged that the tribunal erred in selecting 17 as the multiplier. Since the victim was 22/23 years of age as on date of the accident, 18 should have been selected as the multiplier in tune with the decision of the Supreme Court reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121 [Sarla Verma (Smt.) v. Delhi Transport Corporation]. Referring to the said decision once again, Mr. Mondal contended that the family members of the victim were entirely dependent on him and, therefore, one-third should have been deducted towards personal and living expenses of the victim instead of 50%. It was further contended that only Rs.2,500/- was awarded on account of loss of estate, which is contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court in its decision reported in (2013) 9 SCC 54 (Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others). Finally, he submitted that the amount on account of funeral expenses i.e. Rs.2000/- is extremely inadequate. He, accordingly, prayed for reassessment of the compensation payable to the cross-objectors/claimants by the insurer. 6. We have heard learned advocates for the parties and perused the materials on record. Bearing in mind the limited points which we are required to decide, narration of the factual aspects in detail is considered unnecessary. Suffice it to note that the cross-objectors/claimants had adduced evidence before the tribunal to show that the victim had obtained certificate of enlistment from the local panchayat and registration certificate of vocational education and training. While proving these two documents, the cross-objector/claimant no.1 had deposed of the victim being in receipt of Rs.10,000/- to Rs.15,000/- per month as monthly income. Only on the ground of absence of any document regarding the monthly income of the victim, the tribunal considered the version of the cross- objector/claimant no.1 to be ""not believable"" and proceeded to determine compensation on the basis of Rs.3,000/- as monthly income of the victim. 7. Law is well settled that determination of compensation, in a case of the present nature, cannot be made with mathematical precision. The endeavour of the tribunal/court must be directed towards awarding compensation that is just, meaning thereby that every effort should be made to place the family of the deceased victim in the same position had the victim been alive. 8. Mr. Mondal is right in his contention that the tribunal did not assign any reason as to why the version of the cross-objector/claimant no.1 was not believable. He invited our attention to the claim application as well as the version in cross- examination, where the cross-objector/claimant no.1 stood firm in his version that the victim had an earning of Rs.10,000/- per month. Reacting to such point raised by Mr. Mondal, it was submitted by Mr. Singh that Rs.10,000/- is an exaggerated figure. According to him, the victim was the resident of a rural area and it is too hard to expect that the victim would have earned Rs.10,000/- per month only by repairing mobile phones. He also contended that there was no evidence to prove that the victim was engaged in selling mobile phones and accessories. 9. In the light of the above submissions and having regard to the facts that apart from the two documents produced by the cross-objector/claimant no.1, referred to above, the PAN card of the victim was also produced before the tribunal, we are of the considered view that interest of justice would be sufficiently served if Rs.6,000/-, which is a plausible figure in the circumstances, is reckoned as the notional monthly income of the victim on the date of his death. 10. However, we do not propose to award any amount on account of future prospects since we can take judicial notice of the fact that now a days the general trend is to purchase a new mobile phone after throwing away the old mobile and that repairs are seldom resorted to. That apart, no evidence of income derived from sale of mobile phones and accessories were led disabling us to proceed in this regard. 11. Although in Sarla Verma (supra), the Supreme Court has referred to the practice of deducting 50% of the income if the deceased was a bachelor, it has also been observed therein that where the family of the bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, his personal and living expenses may be restricted to one-third and contribution to the family will be taken as two-third. The version of the claimant no. 1 that the parents of the victim as well as his siblings were entirely dependent on the income of the victim for their survival, has not been contested by the insurer. In that view of the matter, we propose to assess the compensation payable to the claimants accordingly. 12. We are further in agreement with Mr. Mondal that an incorrect multiplier has been applied by the tribunal. Considering the age of the victim, 18 should have been selected in terms of the decision in Sarla Verma (supra). 13. We are also minded to hold that the tribunal erred in not awarding Rs.1,00,000/- and Rs.25,000/- to the cross-objectors/claimants on account of loss of estate and funeral expenses respectively, having regard to the decision in Rajesh (supra). 14. On consideration of all relevant factors, compensation is reassessed as follows: Sl. Heads Calculation No. (i) Income of the victim Rs.6,000/- per month; (ii) 1/3rd of (i) deducted as 1/3rd of Rs.6000/- = personal expenses of the Rs.2,000/-; victim (iii) Compensation after (Rs.4,000/- x 12 x 18) = multiplier of 18 is applied Rs.8,64,000/-; (iv) Loss of estate Rs.1,00,000/-; and (v) Funeral expenses Rs.25,000/- Total Compensation Rs.9,89,000/- 15. The aforesaid sum shall carry interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim application till realization, and shall be payable within a month from date of receipt of a copy of this judgment and order. 16. The appellant-insurer is directed to issue an account payee cheque favouring the claimant no. 1 for the total sum payable on account of compensation and deposit the same in the office of the Registrar General. He shall then proceed to deliver the cheque to the claimant no. 1 in accordance with law. The sum secured by the appellant-insurer in terms of our order dated April 21, 2017 shall be returned by the Registrar General to it. 17. With the aforesaid modification of the impugned award and the consequent directions, the appeal and the connected application for stay together with the cross-objection stand disposed of. Urgent photostat certified copy of this judgment and order, if applied for, may be furnished to the applicant at an early date. (DIPANKAR DATTA, J.) DEBI PROSAD DEY, J. :

https://www.prokerala.com/news/articles/a1044247.html,Nine companies in BSE 500 where promoter stake went north see boost in stock price,2020-05-23,prokerala.com,,Aavas Financiers,"[{""entity"": ""Aavas Financiers"", ""date"": ""2020-08-19"", ""action_type"": ""upgrade"", ""outcome"": ""positive"", ""days_before"": 88}]","New Delhi, May 23 : What is the correlation between promoters increasing their
stakeholding in companies and the consequent impact on the company's share price?
Usually, an increase in promoter stake is seen as a sign of confidence in the company by the promoter group and is sometimes used as a tactic to give confidence to the markets that the promoters see value in the company when the price is depressed.
Nine companies in the BSE 500 saw an increase in promoter holding during the march quarter compared to the December quarter of 2019. These companies also saw an increase in the share price between December and May.
According to a report by LKP Securities, Aurobindo Pharma, JB Chemicals, Deepak Nitrite, Vaibhav Global, Mindtree, Tata Consumer, Sun Pharma, Deepak Fertilisers and Bajaj Electricals are among the nine companies where the promoters stake increased between December and March and the stock price increased between December 31-May 20.
Aurobindo Pharma was up by 55 per cent, JB Chemicals up by 52 per cent and Deepak Nitrite were among the top three gainers although the promoter stake only increased marginally by 0.14 per cent, 0.23 per cent and 0.05 per cent respectively.
There is also a category of 12 companies where the promoter stake increased during the quarter and the stock price decreased during the last five months.

The private sector lender's share price had plunged by nearly 30 per cent during intra-day trade on Tuesday (October 1), before closing the session down by 22.8 per cent at Rs 32.
""This fall was primarily on account of the forced sale of 10 crores equity shares (3.92 per cent of the bank's equity share capital) triggered by an invocation of pledge on the equity shares of a large stakeholder,"" it said in a filing to the stock exchanges.
With this sale, the entire pledge stands extinguished and all sale under the same duly completed, it added.
RNAM) had on Tuesday directed its trustees to sell the remaining shares pledged by Rana Kapoor, co-founder of Yes Bank, as a collateral with the mutual fund house, sources said.
""RNAM has given instruction to its trustees to sell entire holding of Kapoor in Yes Bank,"" a source had said on Tuesday.
In its filing on Wednesday, Yes Bank also asserted that its financial and operating metrics remain intrinsically stable.
""Over the past few days, unfounded speculations regarding the bank's deposits/liquidity have been brought to its notice. In this regard, kindly note that the bank had a Liquidity Coverage Ratio in excess of 125 per cent as on September 30, 2019, which is well above the minimum regulatory requirement of 100 per cent,"" it said.
The bank's gross advances as on September 30, 2019 stood at Rs 2.32 lakh crore, as against Rs 2.42 lakh crore by June-end 2019, with a higher share of retail advances compared to June, it added.
The reduction in advances was effected to enhance capital efficiency, Yes Bank said.
""Further, deposits aggregated to Rs 2.09 lakh crore as on September 30, 2019. CASA Ratio improved to nearly 30.8 per cent as compared to 30.2 per cent as on June 30, 2019,"" it said.
Kapoor and his group entities had sold 2.16 per cent of their stake in the bank worth Rs 510 crore through open market transaction on September 26-27.
After this, Kapoor and his group entities' stake in the bank came down to 4.72 per cent.
Earlier last week, Yes Capital, one of the promoter entities of Yes Bank, sold 1.8 per cent stake in the private sector lender.
The stake sale helped the promoter group entity mop up around Rs 240 crore.
Last month, another promoter Morgan Credits had sold 2.3 per cent stake in Yes Bank for Rs 337 crore to prepay a certain part of its outstanding dues to Reliance Nippon Life AMC.

However, data shows that 65% of stocks in these indices have plunged by double digits from their respective 52-week highs.
The list includes some popular stocks, such as Waaree Renewable Technologies, Spandana Sphoorty Financial, Fusion Micro Finance, EKI Energy Services, Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company, and 63 Moons Technologies, which are down over 50% from their year-high levels.
With a fall of 85%, Sanmit Infra emerged as the top loser on the list. The scrip fell to Rs 14.08 on August 29, 2024 from its 52-week high of Rs 90.92. MK Proteins emerged as the second biggest loser. Shares of the company declined 68% to Rs 10.67 on August 29, 2024 from its 52-week high of Rs 33.33, scaled on November 10, 2023.
Cressanda Railway Solutions, Lancer Container Lines, and HLV Ltd also declined 63%, 58% and 50% from their respective 52-week high levels.
The 30-share index Sensex and BSE Midcap scaled all-time highs of 82,637.03 and 49186.33, respectively, on August 30, 2024. On the other hand, the BSE Smallcap index hit an all-time high of 56,416.31 on August 28, 2024. Going ahead, PL Capital believes that the US elections are the most important factor to watch out for given rising geo political tensions globally (including SE Asia).
“We expect some tilt towards defensives like consumer, durables, building material, IT services, pharma and telecom, given rich valuations in some growth sectors. Capital goods, infra, logistics/ ports, EMS, hospitals, tourism, auto, new energy, E-com are great themes, but investors need to be cognizant of valuations,” the brokerage said in a report.
Among the other major losers, Coffee Day Enterprises, Best Agrolife, TruCap Finance, Salasar Techno Engineering, India Pesticides, Quint Digital, Medicamen Biotech, Divgi Torqtransfer Systems, Sai Silks (Kalamandir), Tatva Chintan Pharma Chem, 3I Infotech, Rajesh Exports and Camlin Fine Sciences also declined somewhere between 45%-50% from their 52-week high levels.
While giving his advice to investors, Sandip Bansal, Senior Portfolio Manager, ASK Investment Managers said, “There are pockets of excesses within in midcap and smallcap space. However, it would not be fair to paint the entire basket with one brush. Many businesses have seen a sharp improvement in earnings or long-term growth prospects. In such cases, the returns have a fundamental basis and are not necessarily due to liquidity-chasing stocks. Going ahead, it may become more stock-specific, with returns aligning themselves with those companies that deliver on high expectations.”

The private sector bank's board had said earlier this week that it would seek approval of the Reserve Bank of India for an extension to his term beyond January, as it needs more time to identify and groom a successor. Friday's fall takes the total plunge in Yes Bank shares to more than 42.5 per cent since the RBI directive on September 21.
Mr Kapoor said on microblogging site Twitter on Friday that he was committed to the interests of Yes Bank and its stakeholders.
""In this leadership transition at Yes Bank, I continue to remain fully committed to the interests of the Bank and all its stakeholders. I will be fully guided by the Board of Directors of Yes Bank and the Reserve Bank of India,"" Mr Kapoor said.
""I will eventually bequeath my Yes Bank promoter shares to my 3 daughters and subsequently to their children, with a request in my will stating not to sell a single share...,"" Mr Kapoor tweeted from his Twitter handle @ RanaKapoor_.
Even after I demit office as MD & CEO of YES BANK, I will never ever sell my @YESBANK shares
I will eventually bequeath my @YESBANK Promoter shares to my 3 daughters and subsequently to their children, with a request in my Will stating not to sell a single share, as Diamonds are Forever!!

On Friday, Yes Bank shares touched their fresh 52-week low of Rs 166.15 in intraday trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), before closing at Rs 183.45, down Rs 19.75 or 9.72 per cent. On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), Yes Bank shares hit a 52-week low of Rs 165, before ending at Rs 184.10, with a loss of Rs 19.15 or 9.42 per cent.
As of end-June, Mr Kapoor had a direct 4.3 per cent stake in Yes Bank, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.
Earlier this week, Yes Bank said that it would seek the nod of the central bank to extend Mr Kapoor's tenure until September 30, 2019. The central bank has only allowed Mr Kapoor to stay at the helm of affairs till January 31, 2019.
Yes Bank share price has declined a total of 46.5 per cent this month. Analysts attribute the sharp losses in the stock to uncertainty around extension of Mr Kapoor's current tenure, which ends on January 31.
""The bank's woes will continue till there is uncertainty around it,"" R Sreesankar, co-head-institutional equities at Prabhudas Lilladher, was quoted as saying in a report by news agency Reuters.
On Thursday, in response to a query by the NSE, Yes Bank denied any dealings with Three Sisters Family Office, the investment vehicle run by Mr Kapoor's three daughters, stated the Reuters report.

In yet another surprise move, the RBI has cut repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent from 6 per cent.
This announcement made today, as a part of the monetary policy meeting, will be put to action with immediate effect. This is the third time in a row that the RBI has altered the repo rate this year. In justification, the Monetary Policy Committee has mentioned that the growth impulses within the economy have deteriorated prominently over the past months. With this move, the RBI looks to strengthen India's GDP. The committee has also unanimously voted to observe the 'accommodating' status unlike the 'neutral' status that it held until now.
Just after the announcement was made, volatility hit the market. For those looking to make some smart investment choices in this volatile market, Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit is the most preferred investment option. Since it is not linked to the market, it offers assured returns and leaves nothing to chance. Here's why investors must consider investing in a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit.
Guaranteed returns

Bajaj Finance FD offers an interest rate of up to 8.60 per cent for new customers, and 8.85 per cent for existing customers and employees. Those looking to renew their FD can benefit from an additional 0.10 per cent interest on their existing interest rate.

Flexible tenor
Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit enables investors to choose a timeline for their investment, depending on their goals. Regular investors can choose a tenor of 12 to 60 months or simply park your money in a special tenor FD to benefit from higher interest rates.

Hassle-free investment process
Right from planning your investment to executing it, Bajaj Finance ensures accessibility and ease. Investors can use the FD calculator to plan their investments, and choose the investment amount, tenor, and payout frequency, as per their convenience.

For those looking to grow their savings, it is prudent to invest a portion of your corpus in Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit right now. This is because apart from the repo rate cuts, the Union Budget 2019 is all set to be formalised on 5th July, 2019. The budget results can signal a more economic volatility and can re-alter several interest rate structures. So, lock in the high interest rate offering right now to seize your opportunity and stay on firm ground with your investment even if volatility strikes.

Here's what Viraj Vyas of Ashika Stock Broking recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:
Central Depository Services (CDSL)
The stock has been a notable outperformer since the March 2020 lows, making a substantial ascent from Rs 180 to Rs 1,680 in just a few months. However, following its all-time high in December 2022, the stock entered a phase of both time and price correction.
In June 2023, there was a pivotal development as the stock broke above a declining trendline. This breakout suggests the potential for a rectangle breakout, signifying a potentially significant bullish move.
The stock, listed as a demerged entity from Piramal Enterprises, has been entrenched in a pronounced downtrend since November 2022. However, there are now signs of a potential trend reversal.
The stock appears to be forming a Cup & Handle formation, which is often an indication of accumulation. A confirmation with a close above Rs 109, supported by substantial trading volumes, could signify the initiation of a fresh bullish upswing in the stock.
Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT)
The stock is currently trading near its all-time highs and is displaying robust relative strength compared to the Nifty50 index. It has been on an upward trajectory since April 2023, characterized by a series of higher highs and higher lows.
The recent price action indicates a mild corrective move following a strong rally, with the stock finding support at Rs 650 levels. A breakout above Rs 765 could signal the potential for another fresh high in the making.

Time horizon given by the brokerage is one year.
View of the brokerage-
Deceleration in disbursement growth and near-term uncertainty weighing on AUM growth: CIFC’s disbursement growth decelerated sharply to 11 per cent yoy in Q4 FY19 from 26 per cent yoy in 9m FY19.
This led to overall AUM growth coming-off to 26 per cent yoy from 29 per cent yoy in the preceding quarter.
However, one would have expected CIFC to have fared better considering strong positioning in rural/semi-urban markets, well-diversified product portfolio (including 25 per cent share of used vehicle and refinance) and opportunity to grab market from liquidity-constrained NBFCs.
In the Home Equity (HE) business, there was a material pick-up in disbursements (growth at 28 per cent yoy v/s 18 per cent yoy for 9m FY19) which led to stabilization of AUM growth at 15-16 per cent yoy despite elevated run-offs.
In the wake of uncertainty stemming from elections and monsoon, the management was averse to paint a buoyant growth picture for FY20.
In VF segment, it expects a 15 per cent disbursement growth (could be upgraded later based on BS-VI pre-buying trend) and in HE business, CIFC expects a 15 per cent AUM growth. The company is better-positioned than most other NBFCs on the liquidity front.
Stable NIM, spike in opex and improvement in asset quality: CIFC’s NIM was flat qoq at 6.8 per cent; both funding cost and portfolio yield inched up 10-20bps qoq.
The company has been carrying a substantially higher cash balance since Dec 2018. In VF segment, the NIM sequentially improved by 40bps to 7.6 per cent driven by lending rate hikes taken in the past six months across products.
In HE business, NIM dipped 40bps qoq as income yield contracted due to lower upfront assignment income (Rs120mn v/s 310mn in Q3 FY19). Opex ratio climbed to 2.9 per cent in Q4 on account of investment being incurred on branch additions.
CIFC plans to add about 100 branches (FY19 base of 900) in Q1 FY20, and the company has recruited resources to straightaway kick-start their operations.
The company’s Gross and Net Stage-3 assets declined by 12-16 per cent qoq with their ratio falling by 40-50bps on sequential basis. As per I-GAAP, the Net NPL ratio at 1.1 per cent was at an all-time low.
Such sharp correction in asset quality was driven by seasonally stronger collections in VF business and encouraging NPL recoveries in HE segment realized through the SARFAESI process.
The credit cost in both business segments declined by 40-50bps qoq. The mild fall in ECL coverage on Stage 1 & 2 assets can be construed to be driven by an improvement in early bucket collections.
Macro uncertainty and near-full valuation caps upside: CIFC has historically demonstrated impressive growth and asset quality resilience through challenging phases.
While the next couple of years could mark a sluggish period for VF business; the HE portfolio would likely improve on its growth rate with resurrection of operating model compete.
In our view, NIM should stabilize as the company possesses the ability to pass-on any durable increase in funding cost.
Credit cost should trend steadily if the monsoon is satisfactory and fuel cost remains under control. Post factoring conservative assumptions on growth and asset quality front, we estimate CIFC to deliver 15-16 per cent earnings CAGR over FY19-21. The company trades at 2.9x FY21 P/ABV.

Yes Bank is on everyone’s radar after posting the abysmal numbers. The provisions have come in nine-fold higher at Rs 3,660 crore and a net loss of Rs 1,500 crore. Are you looking at this as a start to cleaning up the mess that was left behind or do you see this as a major challenge for Yes Bank in terms of capital raising exercise?
If you look at the overall growth over the last three to four years, it was largely led by the advances to certain highly sensitive, high-risk sectors and now that they will have to really go a bit slow and a calibrated approach will have to be taken. The growth over the next few quarters will remain muted. More importantly, one has to see how the management is able to change their liability franchise which is not so great compared to some of the other banks.
The next couple of quarters are going to be extremely crucial for the stock price performance. We believe that the stock has corrected and is looking attractive. Next two quarters may remain challenging but from a 12-months’ or a 18-months’ perspective, the stock remains quite attractive. We have kept a hold rating on the stock with a target price of about Rs 275.
What is in store for steel as a sector in terms of earnings?
What are your expectations from Kotak? Do you think commentary as well the spat with RBI may take the centrestage?
We are looking at a very stable set of numbers from Kotak Bank. We are looking at about 21% growth in net interest income. The overall net interest margins will remain in the at 3.6% or thereabouts. We might be able to see a very healthy loan growth of 24%. Kotak has been growing with a very decent rate with a very good asset quality and franchise of other portfolio and fee income. We are extremely positive on Kotak Bank both from a quarterly numbers perspective as well as from investment perspective over the next 12 months. It remains our preferred pick.
At what price would you like to buy Yes Bank? Or would you rather focus on ICICI Bank and Axis Bank?
It is difficult to pinpoint a specific price level but the way we look at the whole Yes Bank episode is that the stock has corrected more than 60% from August till November. Now, there is a new management in place and they have started the clean-up process. So, next two or three quarters are going to be challenging.
Particularly with respect to their liability franchise and focus on the working capital part versus the risky business that the companies was doing, the overall growth expectations are going to be muted. At the same time, at this particular valuation, once you see some kind of improvement in the numbers, the stock will start reacting very fast because it is a high beta stock.
Just to give you a parallel, when Axis Bank reported extremely high NPLs in the watch list, that was a time that the stock made a bottom. It is going to be extremely difficult for anybody to finetune and when the management starts reporting better numbers, over the next two quarters, it is going to be very tricky. But the downside from current level in Yes Bank would not be more than 20-22%.

All the three IPOs have received 'subscribe' ratings from brokerages, but analysts prefer Bikaji Foods among the three. They also see better chances of listing gains in case of the ethnic snacks maker.
Astha Jain of Hem Securities prefer Bikaji Foods, followed by Global Health and Fusion Micro Finance.
Jain said Bikaji Foods' asking valuations is a bit on a higher side, but she still prefers it, thanks to strong brand recall, its positioning in the ethnic snacks market and growth plans. In case of Global Heath, she said low occupancy rate is a concern, but it is a decent candidate overall and could deliver well in the long-term. She sees limited listing gains for Global Health.
In case of Fusion Micro Finance, financial ratios are solid and the overall fundamentals are good, but there are industry-related concerns, Jain said.
Narottam Dharawat of Dharawat Securities also prefers Bikaji Foods International among the three. He sees better chances of Bikaji Foods delivering a listing pop. ""It's listing could surprise on the upside,"" he said.
As far as Angel One is concerned, the brokerage said investors looking for listing gains can look at Bikaji Foods. Global Health and Fusion Micro Finance are good opportunities for long term investors.
Considering Global Health's strong brand recall, market position and healthy financial performance, Angel One believes the multi-speciality tertiary care provider can create a good opportunity for long term investing.
For Fusion Micro Finance, it said while the NBFC saw growth in top line, it posted fall in profits due to spill over effects of the pandemic, and expansion spending from FY20 to FY22. Recovery has been strong for the company as indicated in Q1FY23 results, it said while suggesting the IPO for long term investors.
Meanwhile, Arijit Malakar, Head of Research for Retail at Ashika Group finds Global Health IPO reasonably valued.
""Bikaji IPO is expensively valued and leaves little room for upside amid a volatile market. Meanwhile, since rural India is under pressure, there are headwinds in the microfinance industry and hence investors should remain cautious over the Fusion Micro Finance issue,"" he Malkar said.
On its Day 2 of the bidding process, the IPO of Fusion Micro Finance was subscribed 17 per cent by 11.55 am. Global Health IPO was subscribed 3 per cent while Bikaji Foods International IPO was subscribed 20 per cent.
At the upper limit of the price band Rs 350-368, the Fusion Micro Finance IPO was demanding 1.9 times adjusted FY22 book value per share (BVPS) and 168 times FY22 diluted EPS. Nirmal Bang has subscribe rating on the issue. Swastika Investmart recommended a ‘subscribe’ rating but said the issue is only for high-risk investors with a long-term view. Angel One has a neutral rating on the issue. Hem Securities Astha Jain said the issue is for investors with risk appetite.
In case of Bikaji, analysts said the asking IPO valuations are expensive but they largely have a ‘subscribe’ rating on the issue due to Bikaji’s brand recall and better revenue and PAT growth than peers over the last two years.
""BFIL, with its strong market position across its diversified product portfolio, strong distribution, strategically manufacturing facilities, strong brand visibility and consistent financial performance is in a good position with healthy visibility going ahead,"" said LKP Securities in a note.
Choice Broking has assigned a 'Subscribe with Caution' rating on the issue. Geojit finds the asking valuations expensive but has advised 'subscribe' on the issue, considering Bikaji's consistent top-line growth, industry leading position, future expansion plans, new product launches, investments in strengthening the brand recall and good future prospects
In case of Global Health, Geojit has assigned a 'subscribe' rating from a short to medium term basis. Choice Broking also has assigned a 'subscribe' recommendation to the share sale.

""It's a very good interest rate given the uncertainty in the economy and also the industry post Covid lockdown,""says a debt dealer.
The current yield on a 10 year G-Sec is around 5.90 per cent. There is, however, a likelihood of this rate touching 6 per cent or going even beyond because of a large supply of government paper in the market on account of higher borrowings this year.
This week states like Goa, Telangana and Rajasthan paid around 6.6 per cent for 10 year state development bonds.
The HDFC Ltd which is a triple A rated corporate got this money from two large private sector banks -- ICICI Bank and Axis Bank Ltd. Axis Bank took the largest share of Rs 2,650 crore while ICICI Bank put in Rs 1,350 crore.
The Mumbai-headquartered NBFC, which is also a holding company for HDFC Bank, HDFC Life , HDFC Ergo among other companies, has raised the money through non-convertible debentures. These debentures would be redeemed after a period of 10 years. The longer term funds are much needed in the NBFC space as it brings stability in asset liability management. In many NBFCs, the liabilities are short term, while the assets (home loan) are long term in nature.
The risk averse banks flush with funds are comfortable investing in the debt paper of good investment grade companies. The recent raising of money by HDFC Ltd and Reliance Industries would act as a benchmark for corporates with strong balance sheet to negotiate interest rate with banks via debentures for raising short as well as long-term funds.
The HDFC Ltd is in the market to raise around Rs 14, 000 crore post covid outbreak. The housing major is building capital buffers especially raising long term resources. The new money would be utilised for financing new business and refinancing old loans,
Early this month, HDFC raised Rs 5,000 crore from ICICI Bank, PNB Gilt, UTI and few mutual funds. It raised money via debentures at 6.22 per cent for less than 2 years. The current low interest rate environment offers a good opportunity for strong corporate and institutions to borrow at a good rate.

These factors impacted mutual fund (MF) industry as well.
MF industry's assets de-grew to Rs 22 lakh crore on the back of volatile markets in September and large outflows from liquid funds, the ICICIdirect research said in a note. Mutual Funds asset base was at a record Rs 25.20 lakh crore by August-end.
Equity-oriented funds constitute 46 percent, debt funds constitute 33 percent and liquid funds constitute 18 percent of the total assets. The monthly drop in the asset base is mainly due to an outflow of over Rs 2 lakh crore from mutual fund schemes.
Debt and liquid funds predominantly have institutional investors, while equity-oriented funds mostly have individual investors.
Redemption pressure was evident in liquid funds which saw a withdrawal of Rs 2.11 lakh crore. Liquid funds, or money market segment, invest in cash assets such as treasury bills, certificates of deposit and commercial paper for a shorter horizon.
Fears of a liquidity crunch following the IL&FS crisis hit the mutual fund industry in September. Cash plans, or liquid funds, were the worst hit.
MF experts said industry faced huge redemption pressure in September after liquidity in the banking system tightened.
Despite steep fall in equity markets, equity and equity-linked saving scheme (ELSS) saw an infusion of Rs 11,250 crore. Besides, balanced funds witnessed an inflow of Rs 731 crore.
The S&P BSE Sensex lost more than 6.2 percent in September — the worst fall in the month of September since 2008. The Sensex had fallen by about 10 percent in September 2008.

The fundraiser will comprise a mix of a qualified institutional placement (QIP) and American depository receipts (ADR), the company informed stock exchanges. Only domestic institutional investors will participate in the QIP.
Indian banks have been busy raising funds in the past 12-18 months, with several large QIP offerings from both private sector and state-owned banks. Last year, State Bank of India raised ₹ 15,000 crore through a QIP, while private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank raised ₹ 5,803 crore.
In December, HDFC Bank said it is planning to raise up to ₹ 24,000 crore through a combination of preferential allotment and QIP. Earlier in July, the bank had raised ₹ 8,500 crore from HDFC Ltd through a preferential allotment. In February 2015, HDFC Bank raised ₹ 10,000 crore through a mix of QIP and ADRs, with around ₹ 2,000 crore through the domestic QIP and the rest through an overseas share sale.
The lender has fixed a floor price of ₹ 2,179.13 for the QIP, according to the stock exchange filing.
Shares of HDFC Bank closed 1.4% lower on the BSE on Monday at ₹ 2,172.25.
“The bank is offering shares at a price of ₹ 2,169.9 per share. They are looking at a base size of ₹ 2,000 crore for the QIP offering and a cap of ₹ 3,750 crore,” said a person aware of the bank’s fundraising plans, on the condition of anonymity. “The rest of the capital will be raised from the ADR issuance.”
HDFC Bank intends to use the funds to strengthen its capital structure and ensure adequate capital to support growth and expansion, including enhancing its solvency and capital adequacy ratio, the lender said in its offer document.
Investment banks DSP Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and others are managing the HDFC Bank share sale.
The HDFC Bank share sale follows the successful initial share sale of the HDFC Group mutual funds business—HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd—which sold shares worth ₹ 2,800 crore in its IPO that closed on 27 July.
The HDFC Asset Management IPO was subscribed over 83 times.
In March, HDFC Ltd raised ₹ 1,896 crore through a QIP. It raised a further ₹ 11,104 crore from top institutional investors like KKR, GIC and Premji Invest, among others.",pass,ambiguous

Rating firms believe Kapoor’s exit might make raising fresh capital, growing deposits harder for the lender
YES Bank's shares are likely to tumble today as Citigroup and IDFC Securities slashed their ratings on the bank a day after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) asked its chief executive to step down after January 31.
On Wednesday, the central bank rejected the lender’s request to extend the tenure of its promoter and CEO Rana Kapoor by three years. RBI has asked the bank's Board to find a replacement. The 61-year-old Kapoor owns over 10% in the mid-sized bank.
Citi and IDFC Securities believe that Kapoor’s imminent exit might make raising fresh capital as well as growing deposits and fee income harder for the Mumbai-based lender.
On Wednesday, YES Bank stock closed at Rs 318.50, down 1.44% from the previous close. Intra-day, it touched a 52-week high of Rs 404 and a low of Rs 285.
Citi has downgraded the stock to 'sell' from 'buy' earlier and cut the target price by 39% to Rs 270. It said the premium attached to the bank’s shares for CEO Kapoor “can go away”. While senior management is competent, Kapoor played a significant role in building the company. “Lender might have to defer capital raise, which could slow down growth,” it said.
IDFC Securities downgraded the stock to 'underperformer' from 'neutral' and cut target price to Rs 230 from Rs 350. “Kapoor’s departure will lead to a slowdown in loan and fee growth, which can lead to a sharp fall in valuations. Fresh capital and high net-worth deposits will become difficult to raise,” it said.
Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service on Thursday affirmed the ratings of YES Bank, a day after the RBI move. The firm has also maintained the outlook on the ratings as stable.
The overall issuer rating continues to stand at Baa3, said Moody’s, adding that all the other ratings on the bank have been affirmed.
""YES Bank's profitability is strong, and Moody's expects that the bank can maintain low credit costs over the next 12-18 months,"" the global rating firm said in a note. It added that the growth in both the interest and non-interest income will help the city-headquartered bank maintain ""solid profitability"".
However, it warned that while the bank's current asset quality metrics are strong and superior to that of peers, its ""aggressive growth strategy poses asset risks"".
If the bank is able to maintain the present asset quality ratios and reduce credit risk concentrations, its share of low-cost Casa (current account savings account) deposits improves without affecting the margins and profitability is sustained, Moody's said the bank's rating can move up. However, an increase in non-performing assets or decline in earnings can lead to a downgrade in ratings, it added.

When a trader is expecting the stock prices to fall, he may sell the stock without owning that and buy at a lower price, for example, stock XYZ is trading at 100, a trader sells the stocks at Rs 100 and buys it back at Rs 90. He made a profit of Rs 10. Selling the stocks without owing the underlying stock is called short selling.
Coming to the buildup of fresh short positions, when the stock prices move downward and open interest on the counter increases, it is taken as a sign of a short build-up. The signal is considered more reliable if the volume on the counter has also seen an increase as the stock price was declining.
IndusInd Bank price fell 3.12%, and open interest saw an increase of 26.17%.
Tata Communications price declined 2.54%, and open interest saw a rise of 3.1%.
IDFC saw stock pricing dipping up by 2.01%, and the open interest saw an increase of 3.09%.
RBL Bank stock price dropped by 1.86%, and open interest saw a rise of 9.7%.
Cholamandalam Investment and Finance stock price declined by 1.74%, and open interest saw a rise of 2.53%.
Some additional checks would help traders in taking better trading decisions as they increase the probability of a follow-up of the upward movement in the stock price.
First, if this long build-up is accompanied by any bearish crossover, which means that whether in the current down move when the open interest has moved up the stock price has moved below its 20, 50 or 100-day moving average.
Another couple of points which traders should keep in mind when taking a trade is to look at the matrix of build-up of short positions on the basis of open interest.
Also check whether there is any extraordinary build-up of long positions in any out-of-money put option, especially any far-of-the-money out option. That indicates the probability of any informed person taking exposure through options for any possible downside.

Nandish Shah Nifty50 surged 229 points on August 26 to post its highest absolute gains since May 20. It closed at 11,058 levels. The move was largely on the back of a series of measures announced by the finance minister on August 23 to build the confidence of the capital markets and the auto industry. By closing at 11,058 levels on August 26, the Nifty50 conquered its 20-days EMA hurdle for the first time after the budget day. The Nifty50 was facing resistance around its 20 days exponential moving average and reversed south the moment it touched since the breakdown seen on the budget day. Moreover, on August 23, the Nifty has formed bullish “Piercing line” candlestick pattern on the daily charts. This pattern usually indicates a trend reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) Oscillator has also formed positive divergence on the daily chart of Nifty and Bank Nifty. In the derivatives, we have seen the first sign of long build-up in the Nifty Futures on August 26. Amongst the Options, we have seen Put writing at 10,800-11,000 strike prices, indicating strong support around these levels for the coming days. Unless Nifty closes below it, the trend would be considered bullish for the markets. On the upside, the 11,200 level is likely to act as an immediate resistance where Calls have been written. This level also coincides with the 200-day SMA which is placed at 11,196 levels. The Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices also participated in the rally where they gained by 1.58 percent and 2.34 percent respectively. The Advance decline ratio remained positive for the last two days which is a positive sign. Considering the above indicators, we believe that Midcap/Smallcaps have formed a bottom, and we may see a sharp bounce back from here on. To conclude, the short-term trend for the Nifty has turned bullish. Therefore, our advice would be to accumulate longs in the Nifty with the stop loss placed below 10,800 levels. On the higher side, the Nifty could move to the immediate resistance level of 11,200 levels, and any close above 11,200 levels would result in further short covering which might push Nifty to levels around 11,400-11,500. In the Bank Nifty, one should accumulate long positions with the stop loss of 27,500 levels. On the higher side, the immediate resistance is seen around 28,500 levels, followed by 28,870.
Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 6-10 percent return in the next three-four weeks:Manappuram Finance: Buy| LTP: 123.5| Target: Rs 136|Stop-Loss: Rs 117| Upside 10 percent Manappuram Finance stock price has given a breakout on the daily chart on August 26 by closing above the resistance level of Rs 123 levels. The primary trend of the stock is bullish where the stock price is trading above its 200-Day SMA. Oscillators and momentum indicators like RSI and MACD are showing strength in the stock on the daily charts. In the F&O segment, we have seen long build up in the stock. Therefore, we recommend buying Manappuram Finance for the upside target of Rs 136 and keep a stop loss below at Rs 117.
Axis Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 684| Target: Rs 730| Stop-Loss: Rs 658| Upside 7 percent After forming a double bottom on the daily chart last week, the stock price reversed northward to close above its 5- and 20-Day SMA on August 26 with higher volumes. It has also given a breakout above the downward sloping trendline on the daily charts. Oscillators and momentum indicators like RSI and MACD are showing strength in the stock. In the F&O segment, we have seen a long build-up in the stock. Therefore, we recommend buying Axis Bank for the upside target of Rs 730 and keep a stop loss below Rs 658.
Avenue Supermarts: Buy| LTP: Rs 1,531| Target: Rs 1,620| Stop-Loss: Rs 1,470 |Upside 6 percent D-Mart has broken out on the daily chart On August 26 by closing above the resistance level of Rs 1,515 levels with higher volumes to close at a seven month high. The trend of the stock is bullish in all time frames where the stock price is trading above its 20-, 50-, 200-Day SMA. Oscillators and momentum indicators like RSI and MACD are showing strength in the stock on the daily as well as weekly charts. Therefore, we recommend buying D-Mart for the upside target of Rs 1,620 and keep a stop loss below Rs 1,470

Yes Bank was on the brink of collapse earlier this year due to its past history of providing easy loans, which ended up as non-performing assets - or bad loans - on its books.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took control of Yes Bank, after the bad-debt laden lender failed to raise the capital needed to stay above mandated regulatory requirements.
Since then, State Bank of India (SBI) has stepped in to acquire a stake in Yes Bank and to keep the private sector lender afloat.
SBI's total investment is not likely to exceed Rs 10,000 crore, according to the bank's chairman.
Yes Bank shares closed 2.86 per cent higher at Rs 19.80 apiece on the BSE, outperforming the benchmark Sensex index which rose 1.50 per cent.
At the current level, the Yes Bank stock is down 57.83 per cent so far this year.",pass,ambiguous

Stock broker and wealth management firm IIFL is also in the race but Blackstone’s bid is likely to be better, top sources told BusinessLine .
“Blackstone has the upper hand. L&T Finance has to decide on the bids it has received so far. Then, it will have to be approved by SEBI,” the sources said.
The transaction may be valued at ₹3,500-4,000 crore. Blackstone is hoping for a controlling stake in the company. According to the sources, the L&T Finance board may finalise the deal by August. The fund house had ₹58,012.2 crore worth assets under management and 28.93 lakh live folios as on May 31.
An IIFL spokesperson declined to comment on the deal but a source close to the company said it still had its hat in the ring and could negotiate a better deal if required. Blackstone declined to comment. Axis MF was also in the fray to acquire a stake in L&T MF but its offer was much lower than Blackstone’s, one of the sources said.
Tough market
Experts said foreign players have not been able to establish themselves in India’s MF industry, though many have tried in the past. Earlier, BlackRock exited mutual fund venture with DSP Group.
The Franklin Templeton debacle is the most recent example of how foreign entities have tasted failure in the MF business in India, the experts said.

We have collated a list of three stocks that either hit a fresh 52-week high, or all-time high or saw a volume or a price breakout.
We spoke to an analyst on how one should look at these stocks the next trading day entirely from an educational point of view:
Analyst: Sunil Gurjar, Founder Chartmojo, Author, CFTe
Shriram Finance (All-Time)
Canara Bank (All-Time)
Canara Bank is outperforming the broader market and its sector. A sharp reversal with good volumes is visible on the chart. The counter is getting ready for a fresh breakout. The hurdle at 388 needs to be cleared.
RIL
Reliance Industries is in a downtrend within a falling channel structure. A reversal at the channel support is observed on the charts.
It is advisable to wait for channel resistance at 2335 to be cleared for a fresh long position. If there is a breach of 2210 next week, it might test its base at the 2000 - 2050 level.

Save a portion of salary in Bajaj Finance FD
Pune (Maharashtra) [India], July 6 (ANI/NewsVoir): Saving and investing should be the top priorities for working professionals when it comes to budgeting their earnings.
With the prevalent unprecedented market movements, smart investors are constantly on the lookout for safer investment avenues.
Low risk and assured returns should be the two most sought-after features given the current scenario. One investment tool that has stood the test of time is, the (https://www.bajajfinserv.in/fixed-deposit) fixed deposit. Fixed deposits offer safety of returns as well as stable growth of one's savings.
Reasons to choose Bajaj Finance online FD
Fixed deposit plans are offered by post offices, various banks and non-banking financial companies. With many options available, parking a portion of one's earnings in a financial instrument could be a challenging task. Bajaj Finance is one such financier that not only offers its investors high FD interest rates, but, also a suite of other benefits.
Here's why investing in a Bajaj Finance FD can be a smart move.
Attractive returns
To withdraw substantial returns at maturity, one should invest in a (https://www.bajajfinserv.in/fixed-deposit-application-form?ProductName=FD%27) Bajaj Finance online FD. Senior citizens applying can get an additional rate benefit of 0.25% over and above the base rate, whereas, non-senior citizens can also benefit from an additional 0.10% by applying online. With returns up to 6.75% one can expect to grow their savings and yield a generous amount at maturity.
Suppose a non-senior citizen saves Rs. 1 lakh and invests it in a Bajaj Finance FD for different tenors. The below table shows how different tenors affect interest gains and returns at maturity.
Thus, one can look at attractive FD rates, applicable to different tenors. With the assurance of syable returns on one's deposit, Bajaj Finance online FD can be a preferred investment tool for individuals looking to grow their savings easily.
Flexible payout option
Under non-cumulative fixed deposit, interest payouts can be received periodically. This can be done on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annual basis, according to one's requirements. Periodic payout options are especially helpful for senior citizens who don't have an active source of income after their retirement.
Loan against FD
With Bajaj Finance, one can withdraw prematurely from their fixed deposit, during emergencies. Bajaj Finance offers an easy loan against FD, where the investor can avail a loan against their FD up to 75% of the invested amount. The process of facilitating a loan against FD is undertaken with minimal documentation, quick processing and no additional charges.
Easy online process
One doesn't have to suffer the exhaustion of waiting in long queues, as investments can be made in Bajaj Finance online FD plans from the comfort of one's home. An additional FD interest rate of 0.10% can be earned by utilizing this end-to-end paperless investment procedure.
For confirming the returns that apply to the FD type and tenor one has decided to go with, they can visit the fixed deposit calculator page available on Bajaj Finserv's website.
Bajaj Finance online FD is a haven for investing earnings. This can be verified from the high credit ratings it has received from CRISIL (FAAA) and ICRA (MAAA) which are the leading credit rating agencies in India.

The students, who were moving around, were least bothered about what was happening inside. Some shareholders who walked into the hall were visibly unhappy, while others were wearing sympathetic smiles.
Mother, Kokilaben, wife Tina and sons Anmol and Anshul came with Anil Ambani to the venue of five back-to-back AGMs of Reliance group companies. The celebratory mood of the Ambani clan during the AGMs of Anil's elder brother, Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries (RIL), was clearly missing. The reasons were clear: most of Anil Ambani's Reliance group companies have lost 90 per cent of their market value in the last two years; one company (Reliance Communications) has been declared bankrupt; and three more businesses are in line for defaulting on loans.
Ambani's speeches started with praises for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP for their thumping victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha election and ""big-bang reforms"" of government. He blamed the crisis in financial services sector, irrational action by auditors and rating agencies for the fall of his companies.

When the shareholders' turn came, companies have tried to choose their yes-men to get the first chance. One shareholder sarcastically said the allegations of Rahul Baba (Rahul Gandhi) in the Rafale jet purchase deal has been proved wrong with the thumping victory of PM Modi. Many other shareholders wanted Ambani to induct his sons on the board of power and infrastructure companies. ""We have seen Dhirubhai sitting in the middle of Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani at AGMs. Now we want Anmol and Anshul along with you on the board during testing times,"" a shareholder said.
The critics were less in number and remained silent most of the time. A shareholder of Reliance Power took a different path and said, ""You keep praising Modi, and the same Modi ruined your company."" Ambani was seen shedding his past aggressive reactions and patiently listening to attacks. Another shareholder of the power business, who introduced himself as a corporate lawyer, went to the extreme of threatening Ambani to make history by filing the country's first class action suit against the group companies as he lost about Rs 3 crore investments during the downward spiral of share prices. He wanted the issues he raised be addressed within the next two- three months.

While dissident shareholders were thundering inside the hall, other shareholders walking into the hall were heard shouting at the bouncers for aggressively frisking their bags. While the mercury was rising at the third AGM, mother Kokilaben was seen walking out and was dropped off by Anmol and Anshul, both of them dressed in similar suits, and they sported a moustache and beard. During the AGM Ambani announced that the group is exiting the home and commercial loan businesses because of defaults.
Some of the shareholders were seen asking employees about the shift in the AGM venue from the swanky Birla Matoshree in South Mumbai. An executive whispered that Ambani is an alumnus of KC college. Has the crisis forced him to go back to basics?",review_promoted,ambiguous

While SoftBank’s $100-billion Vision Fund has pumped in a capital of $390 million (₹2,800 crore) in OakNorth Bank, the remaining funding ($50 million) has come from an existing investor, Clermont Group.
The $440-million funding will be used to expand OakNorth’s SME loan origination and credit capabilities to North American banks and lending institutions, helping them build the scale and quality of their SME loan books.
It will also continue to drive growth of the OakNorth Analytical Intelligence (ON AI) platform, which is already being used by banks across the US, Europe and Asia.
This funding deal would give three-year-old OakNorth a valuation of $2.8 billion, making it Europe’s most-valuable private fintech.
This round takes OakNorth’s total primary and secondary funding to over $1 billion, more than any other fintech in Europe. It may be recalled that Indiabulls Housing Finance seeded OakNorth Bank with an investment of ₹650 crore for a 40 per cent controlling stake in November 2015 at a valuation of $250 million.
Last year, Indiabulls Housing Finance sold a part of its holding in OakNorth to GIC of Singapore for ₹900 crore. As on date, Indiabulls Housing Finance has a 15 per cent stake in OakNorth Bank.
Commenting on the SoftBank-led investment round in OakNorth, Gagan Banga, Vice-Chairman and MD, Indiabulls Housing Finance, said: “OakNorth Bank has turned out to be an excellent investment for us, as it is evident from the numbers and the manifold increase in valuation since our investment. Our investment is now valued at ₹3,000 crore.”
Besides Indiabulls Housing Finance and SoftBank, OakNorth Bank now counts GIC (of the Government of Singapore), Clermont, Coltrane, Dascoli and Toscafund as other large investors.
In a short span of three years, OakNorth has built a loan book in excess of $1.7 billion, garnering deposits of over $1.5 billion. OakNorth Bank now has a net worth of $1 billion and raises deposits exclusively online through digital channels.

(HDFC ERGO Health), erstwhile Apollo Munich Health Insurance Company (Apollo Munich), has launched a new brand campaign ‘Bad News – Good News’, that communicates about the acquisition of Apollo Munich by HDFC Ltd. in the General Insurance sector and the many benefits this will now offer to the existing and new customers of HDFC ERGO Health.
Conceptualised by Mullen Lintas, the new ‘Bad News – Good News’ campaign builds a narrative through two campaign videos around patients who have encountered health emergencies. The campaign features Bollywood celebrity Nawazuddin Siddiqui, in binary journalist roles — one who reports the ‘Bad News’ of unfortunate events that individuals have to face as a result of a health emergency and the other Nawaz counters him to deliver ‘Good News’ of Apollo Munich now being renamed to HDFC ERGO Health and the wide suite of benefits which are now available for the customers as a part of the acquisition. Packed with humour, the campaign ends with the tagline ‘India is Now Feeling Better’ which is created to highlight Apollo Munich’s expertise and HDFC’s trust.
Anuj Tyagi, MD and CEO, HDFC ERGO Health Insurance Ltd., said, “The acquisition of Apollo Munich Health Insurance by HDFC Ltd., led to the creation of a new entity, HDFC ERGO Health Insurance. This merger will provide significant benefits to our existing and prospective customers. Trust, Transparency and Fairness across all stakeholders are at the core of the entire HDFC Group and is a promise by HDFC ERGO Health leadership to each one of our policyholders. Further, many of HDFC ERGO General’s best practices, including 10,000+ cashless network hospitals, industry leading turnaround time for cashless claim settlement, seamless online policy issuance and 24x7 customer service helpline are being adopted by HDFC ERGO Health to provide a significantly better experience to all our customers. Our new TVC has been strategically executed to ensure customers are made well aware of the benefits this acquisition has to offer them. We hope to deliver this ‘Good News’ and make our existing & new customers feel better.”
Azazul Haque and Garima Khandelwal, CCO, Mullen Lintas, said, “Our task was to create a high impact campaign to convey the biggest news in General Insurance of Apollo Munich being renamed to HDFC ERGO Health and the benefits this acquisition will offer the consumers. We wanted give the brand a unique idea and put out a clutter breaking campaign. The starting point was that people only think of Health Insurance when they come across any an unfortunate incident related to health around them. And to convey this news, we roped in Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Thus the campaign idea of ‘Bad News – Good News’ was born. We are sure this campaign would do just that and also build a strong resonance of HDFC ERGO Health with Health Insurance.”
This campaign is now live and will feature across all genres of TV, major radio stations, OOH in 17 cities and print media. Moreover, the campaign will also reach out to internet users through a well-spread digital plan.

However, for those looking for the perfect combination of high interest rates and safety of deposits, can invest in the online FD scheme offered by Bajaj Finance.
Bajaj Finance offers attractive FD rates up to 7.25 per cent, along with several other benefits, listed below.
Assured returns on deposit
When comparing the returns offered by Bajaj Finance online FD plans with any other alternative, one can see a remarkable difference in their returns. This is because interest rates offered by Bajaj Finance are much higher than bank or even post-office FD rates. Non-senior citizens can get assured returns up to 7 per cent by investing via offline mediums, and an additional 0.10 per cent rate benefit on investing online, through the Bajaj Finserv website.
Senior citizens will benefit from a 0.25 per cent extra FD rate and they can also get the option of withdrawing the interest payout after every month, quarter, six-month, or year. This helps them to utilize their fixed deposit investment as a source of periodic income.
To examine whether the difference of returns is really sizable or not, let's assume that an amount of Rs. 30,00,000 has to be invested in a fixed deposit for 5 years. Before investing, one can compare the returns offered by bank FD, post office FD, and Bajaj Finance FD scheme from the below-given table:
The above table clearly shows how returns on Bajaj Finance FD are higher than other investment avenues. One can find the combination of investment amount and tenor that suits one's investment needs perfectly by calculating the returns with a fixed deposit calculator.
Contactless investment process
A head-to-toe online process is adopted by the Bajaj Finance FD scheme that enables the customers to benefit from the contactless investment procedure. One only needs to fill the online form and submit cKYC number or Aadhaar number, instead of going through the strenuous document verification procedures.
Nevertheless, online deposits will grow at a 0.10 per cent higher FD rates on utilizing the contactless investment process and this serves to be a true bonus for online investors, who are below 60 years of age.
De-risk investment portfolio
Only a credible financier like Bajaj Finance can claim to have '0 unclaimed deposits' till date, owing to timely payments to the registered bank account. Additionally, the highest safety ratings of FAAA by CRISIL and MAAA by ICRA establish how safe it is to deposit in the FD plans from Bajaj Finance.
Thus, one can invest in these deposits without worrying about defaults or delayed interest payouts.
Along with attractive FD rates, Bajaj Finance can help in meeting all investment priorities like safety, flexibility, and online investment convenience. One can make a smart choice by investing in a Bajaj Finance online FD and make savings grow easily.

Lack of any fresh development on capital front also weighed on investor sentiment. In the last eight trading session, Yes Bank shares have fallen as much as 12.46 per cent on the BSE.
The stock has plunged nearly 64 per cent year to date despite recent gains after Chief Executive Officer Ravneet Gill said the bank would raise $1.2 billion by selling shares to private equity investors, technology companies and family offices.
Earlier today, YES Bank share opened 1.13 per cent higher at Rs 66.60 apiece on the BSE and touched an intraday high of Rs 67.20. However, the stock soon pared the gains and slipped into negative terrain and hit a day's low of Rs 63.90. Finally, YES Bank share ended day's trade at Rs 64.25 apiece, down 2.43 per cent.
Also Read: YES Bank reports NPA divergence of Rs 2,299 crore for FY19; profit shrinks to Rs 1,084 crore
Investors got fresh jolt after the lender on Tuesday said the Reserve Bank of India found under-reporting of bad loans to the tune of Rs 3,277 crore during the financial year 2018-19. Of this, Rs 1,259 crore has already been classified as gross non-performing assets (NPAs) during September quarter and Rs 2,018 crore is the amount of incremental bad loans, Yes Bank said. Following this disclosure, YES Bank's NPAs may shoot up by 41.5 per cent.
As a result, the bank's net profit come down to Rs 1,084.03 crore for 2018-19 compared to Rs 1,720.28 crore announced earlier due to divergence in bad loans assessed by the RBI.
This was the third financial year when Yes Bank had reported divergence in bad loans and provisioning. During the last fiscal, under-reporting was around Rs 10,000 crore for two years to FY17, which prompted the RBI to not extend Rana Kapoor's reappointment as CEO.

""The bank's management stands irrevocably committed to ensuring the highest standards of accounting and governance transparency. This was also evidenced through the proactive measure of taking Rs 2,100 crore of 'contingency provision' on exposures which were fully 'standard' as on 31 March 2019,"" the bank said in the regulatory filing.
On fund raising plan, the bank said that it intends to convene a meeting of its board of directors by the end of this month to finalise its capital raise.
In a separate development, Rana Kapoor, who co-founded Yes Bank in 2003 and helped it to become India's fourth largest bank, almost sold off his entire holding in the lender. Kapoor, who once vowed never to sell his holding in the bank, holds just 900 shares in the bank.
YES Bank promoter entities, Kapoor, Yes Capital and Morgan Credits sold 2.04 crore shares or 0.80 per cent stake in the bank through open market on 13-14 November, YES Bank said in a filing to the exchange.
Earlier this week, the stock took a hit amid reports that Yes Bank's statutory auditor, BSR & Co., had sought a fresh audit into whistleblower complaints against the bank and ex-CEO Kapoor as it was not satisfied over the way the special audit was conducted by JLN US & Co. The lender, however, had denied the reports of fresh audit in a whistleblower complaint.

LIC Housing, Marico, JK Cement and Motherso Sumi have shed up to 15% in the last four days alongside up to 15% increase in open interest, thus suggesting short buildup at these counters.
Listen to This Article
The Indian stock market has witnessed sharp swings in the last few trading sessions amid fall in global markets. The Yen carry trade unwinding; fears of a recession in the US and rising geo-political crisis have put the bulls on the back foot.
The Sensex and the Nifty dipped close to 4 per cent in the last three trading sessions. The futures & options data from the NSE (National Stock Exchange) shows that the Nifty August futures have declined by 3.8 per cent, while the Bank Nifty futures slipped 3.7 per cent.
The fall in Nifty futures is alongside a 12.7 per cent decrease in the open interest. This is mainly on account of unwinding by foreign investors who held up to 2 lots in index futures as longs for every bet on the short side.
On the other hand, the Bank Nifty paints a slightly tepid picture, as the open interest (OI) has risen by 27 per cent in the last four trading sessions; suggesting a possibility of short buildup in the August contract.
Meanwhile, here are 4 futures & options stocks where shorts seem to have buildup in the last four sessions.

JK Cement had dipped 5.3 per cent as of August 06, alongside an 11 per cent rise in open interest. The stock, however, has gained 2 per cent in trades on Wednesday.
Technically, the stock seems to have bounced back after testing support around its 100-DMA (Daily Moving Average), which stands at Rs 4,175. On its way up the stock is expected to face resistance around the 20-DMA at Rs 4,375; above which the stock can spurt to Rs 4,475 and Rs 4,500 levels.
On the flip side, in case, the 100-DMA support is violated, the stock can slip to Rs 4,075 - Rs 4,025 levels.

Technically, LIC Housing seems on course to test the 200-DMA on the daily scale at Rs 763. The near-term bias is likely to remain weak as long as the stock trades below Rs 670. In case of a pullback, the 100-DMA at Rs 686 followed by the 50-DMA at Rs 735 are likely to act as stiff hurdles.
The options data shows a PCR (Put Call Ratio) reading of 0.44; indicating presence of higher OI in Calls versus Puts. The highest OI in Calls is visible at Rs 800 Strike Price followed by Rs 700 and Rs 680. Highest OI in Puts is seen at Rs 650 Strike followed by Rs 680 and Rs 660.
Marico
Current Price: Rs 642
Support: Rs 633; Rs 585
Resistance: Rs 664

As long as this support is held, the stock can bounce back to Rs 664 levels. On the flip side, break and sustained trade below Rs 633, can trigger a fall towards Rs 585 levels.
Marico PCR stands at 0.5; which implies that for every 1 Put open positions; there were 2 open positions in the Calls. Highest OI in Calls is seen at Rs 700 Strike followed by Rs 680. On the other hand, highest OI in Puts is at Rs 630 and Rs 620 Strikes.
Motherson Sumi
Current Price: Rs 178
Support: Rs 177; Rs 154
Resistance: Rs 183; Rs 203
Motherson Sumi stock has plunged over 11 per cent in the four days on the back of near 13 per cent rise in OI. The stock is seen trading below its 20- and 50-DMA for the third straight day. Break and sustained trade below Rs 177 can trigger a fall towards the 100-DMA, which stands at Rs 154. On the upside, the stock is expected to face resistance around Rs 183 and Rs 203.
The PCR stands at 0.9; suggesting near a about balance between open Calls and Puts position. The highest OI among Calls is visible at Rs 200 and Rs 210 Strikes; In case of Puts, highest OI is seen at Rs 170 and Rs 160 Strikes.

Bajaj Finance has appointed investment banks Moran Stanley,
JM Financial, Kotak Mahindra Capital Co and
Nomura Holdings to help raise around Rs 7000-8000 crore through a
qualified institutional placement or
QIP. The issue that will help the non-banking finance company shore up its equity base, is expected to see a lot of interest from institutional investors in the aftermath of the IL&FS fiasco.
“The company has appointed investment bankers and the road shows will soon begin,” said one of the persons with knowledge of the development.
The company that has seen a steady growth and has been unfazed by the storm that gripped the non-banking finance sector in the company with the IL&FS and DHFL fiasco is expected to see a lot of interest from global as well as domestic institutional investors. “The company plans to come up with the issue around Diwali this year and is expected to raise around Rs 7000-8000 crore,” said another person with knowledge of the deal.
The stick of Bajaj Finance Ltd closed at Rs 3295.00 a share on the bourses, up 1.38% on Thursday. The current market capitalisation of the company is around Rs 1.91 lakh crore.
“The company might look at diluting upto 5% stake in the company,” the person quoted above said.
Bajaj Finance is one of the few NBFCs that have been showcasing strong and sequential growth over the last few years. Bajaj Finance reported consolidated AUM growth of 41% YoY in June 2019 quarter led by rural lending (55% YoY) and mortgages (51%YoY). SME and commercial lending growth slowed down to 34% and 25% YoY respectively. Consumer loans clocked in 40% YoY growth, albeit slower compared to 56% in Q4FY19. Consolidated PAT grew 43% YoY to Rs 1,195 crore in June quarter characterized by continued strong AUM growth coupled with stable margins/asset quality.
One of the key differentiators of Bajaj Finance compared to other NBFCs is its non-core fee income generation. The company doubled such non-core fee income YoY to Rs 1700 crore in FY19. As a percentage of AUM, fee income was up 60bp YoY to 1.7%. While this growth was driven by multiple sources, the one that really stands out is distribution fees, which almost tripled YoY to Rs 670 crore.",pass,ambiguous

With support from the Government of India, CFLI India’s members, including CEOs of leading Indian and international financial institutions and businesses, have worked alongside the multilateral development community to originate innovative financing solutions and strengthen India’s policy enabling environment.
Across e-mobility, circular economy, green hydrogen, and renewables, CFLI India’s climate solutions are focused on sectors aligned with the Government of India’s climate priorities and can be scaled across India and exported globally.
Over the next decade, these solutions will help mobilise private capital towards the $10.1 trillion needed to meet India’s net-zero target by 2070, CFLI India said.
Bloomberg noted that the culmination of this public-private partnership will help India accelerate its clean energy transition and offers the way forward for India and others to reach net-zero targets while also improving public health, creating jobs, and building a stronger and more resilient economy.
“India needs very large investments to achieve the global 1.5-degree pathway in line with the Paris Agreement. CFLI India was formed with an objective of accelerating investment in sustainability sectors in India. Over the last two years, CFLI India members have partnered in developing concepts to address complex issues across themes such as e-mobility, circular economy for water and renewable energy. The concepts include innovative financial structures across the public and private sector for circular water economy, new financial products targeted to increase e-mobility adoption, and catalysing investments for green ammonia and grid upgrades,” said N Chandrasekaran, who is the Chairman of Tata Sons and Co-Chair of CFLI India.
Initiatives
As part of the efforts to mobilise finances, CFLI India member Tata Motors announced partnerships with State Bank of India, HSBC India, HDFC, Axis Bank and Tata Capital to offer attractive loans and leasing solutions for small commercial and retail electric vehicles, with a target of driving 10-12 per cent EV penetration by 2030. The market opportunity in India of this financing mechanism is $2.4-3 billion through 2030.
Similarly, Tata Group and Larsen & Toubro have originated innovative financing structures, specifically a partial risk guarantee vehicle, to enable Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) at a municipal level.
Scoping studies are being discussed with the Government of Maharashtra to identify potential projects. Such structures could have the potential to unlock $2 billion worth of private capital via PPPs by 2030.
Tata Group and Larsen & Toubro are exploring opportunities to work with the World Bank to improve municipal finance in Indian cities.
GIC Private’s affiliate signed an agreement with AM Green, set up by Greenko’s founders, and Gentari, the clean energy division of Malaysia’s oil company Petronas.
This partnership aims to produce 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of green ammonia by 2030. This is expected to accelerate efforts to achieve net zero targets in India as well as in OECD markets.
AM Green Ammonia Holdings will be a fully funded platform under AM Green. It will invest, in phases, in the Indian region of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Himachal Pradesh. The completion of the transaction is subject to fulfilment of relevant and customary condition precedents.
Climate Finance Leadership Initiative (CFLI) was formed in 2019 by Bloomberg, at the request of the United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, to lead a private sector initiative to tackle the challenge of unlocking climate finance at scale in emerging markets.
It has launched country pilots in India and Colombia that convene leading private-sector institutions across the financial value chain to work alongside corporates, policymakers, and multilateral institutions, to identify barriers to investment and deliver catalytic financing and policy solutions that accelerate the deployment of private capital for critical low-carbon, climate-resilient projects.

While Shriram Group wanted better valuation terms, IDFC Bank did not sweeten its offer
The merger deal between IDFC Bank and Shriram Group could not conclude as the bank sought a 40% discount on the value of Shriram Capital, the holding company of the Chennai-based non-banking finance company (NBFC).
While Shriram Group wanted better valuation terms, IDFC Bank did not sweeten its offer.
""IDFC Bank had asked for a 40% discount in the value of Shriram Capital, the holding company of the Shriram Group. This was unacceptable to Shriram Group and IDFC failed to come up with a counter offer,"" a senior officer at Shriram Finance told DNA Money.
The unlisted Shriram Capital was being valued at around Rs 25,000 crore and IDFC at Rs 13,000 crore.
""They were asking for a discount. We told them that Shriram Finance is not a shell company. After that, they never came back with a counter offer,"" the officer said.
On Tuesday, the stock market, however, cheered the break-up. IDFC Bank shares rose 1.25% to end at Rs 56.65 on the BSE, while the shares of Shriram City Union Finance Ltd (SCUF) rose 5.23% to end at Rs 2,300. Shriram Transport Finance Company (STFC), however, fell 1.12% to end at Rs 1,167 on BSE.
IDFC had won a preliminary permit for its banking unit in 2014 and the lender has been publicly traded since November 2015.
The proposed merger between the bank and the NBFC would have created a three-tier structure. This would have meant the merger of Shriram City Union Finance, the group's retail consumer lending business, with IDFC Bank; STFC, the commercial vehicle finance arm, would continue to operate as a 100% subsidiary of IDFC Ltd and be delisted; and Shriram's insurance business would be transferred to IDFC, which would own close to 75% in both life and general insurance businesses.
STFC has almost Rs 80,000 crore of asset under management (AUM) as of March 31, while IDFC Bank has an AUM of Rs 66,500 crore. SCUF, which was to be merged with the bank, has an AUM of Rs 23,000 crore.
On Monday, IDFC Bank informed the stock exchanges that it is discontinuing merger talks with the Shriram Group. ""Despite best efforts, the two groups have not been able to reach an agreement on a mutually acceptable swap ratio. Accordingly, the exclusivity period stands terminated with immediate effect,"" the IDFC note said.
IDFC and Shriram had, on October 5, extended an exclusivity pact for the proposed merger deal to November 8, citing ""the extensive due diligence process involved in the ongoing discussions.""",pass,ambiguous

A combination of capital constraints among NBFCs and renewed aggression from public sector banks (PSBs) has led to this situation, said auto financiers. In a bid to grow their retail portfolio, PSU banks are offering auto loans at 7.25% to 7.7% compared to NBFCs whose rates range from 8.75% to 11%.
While State Bank of India (SBI) is offering auto loans starting from 7.7%, others are even cheaper with Central Bank of India offering loans at 7.25%, followed by
Canara Bank (7.3%), United Bank of India (7.4%) and Indian Overseas Bank (7.55%). “In recent times, NBFCs have lost market share to PSU banks, which have become more aggressive and that includes Tata Motor Finance,” said Tata Motors group CFO P B Balaji. Unlike banks, NBFCs rely on wholesale funds. Banks are now going slow in lending to finance companies with RBI encouraging banks to take the co-lending model to take advantage of NBFCs’ network.
According to M Ramaswamy, chief financial officer at Sundaram Finance, banks are flush with liquidity and can bring down rates. “We are facing pressure in some markets, depending on how aggressive they turn. It is a mixed bag for us — we mostly cater to individuals with higher risk profiles and because of our good ratings, our cost of funds has also come down. So, in certain regions, we have lost market share and in others, we have gained,” he said.
Sundaram Finance saw a 20% gap in loan disbursements in the September-ended quarter, 2020. Cholamandalam Investment & Finance Company (CIFC) saw total disbursements decline by 30% year-on-year in its vehicle finance segment for the quarter-ended September 2020, according to research reports of brokerage firm Motilal Oswal. This excludes the tractor and construction equipment (CE) segments.
Shriram Transport Finance disbursed ₹650 crore of loans, which was half of last year. Also, 97% of disbursements were in the used vehicle segment. “Our focus is on individual and small truck owners who prefer to buy used vehicles. Normally, banks do not lend to used vehicles because it is time-consuming, requires vehicle valuation and ownership transfer paperwork,” said Umesh Revankar, MD & CEO, Shriram Transport Finance.",review_promoted,ambiguous

Ambuja Cements had on Thursday reported a 25.56 per cent year-on-year (YoY) drop in standalone net profit at Rs 495 crore for the March quarter compared with Rs 665 crore in the same quarter last year.

Shares of public sector undertaking (PSU) banks were in focus, with the Nifty PSU Bank index gaining more than 2% and bouncing back 4.4% from its early morning low, as the markets shrug off worries over Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor's exit.
At 02:35 PM; Nifty PSU Bank index was up 2.5% at 2,876, recovering 5% from its intra-day low of 2,747 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). In comparison, the Nifty 50 index was up 0.58% at 10,550, bouncing back 2% from its early morning low of 10,334.
The RBI governor, Dr. Urjit Patel, resigned from his position, effective 10th December 2018, citing personal reasons. The government has been seeking the relaxation of Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) norms for PSU banks, which if relaxed, would be positive for those banks, according to a brokerage firm.
“There are four major areas where the government and the RBI need to find a common ground the proposal to use the RBI’s balance sheet to recapitalize public sector banks, easing norms for banks under the (PCA) mechanism, additional liquidity window for NBFCs and setting up of an independent regulator for payment systems outside the RBI,” Motilal Oswal Securities said in a client note.
Meanwhile, shares of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), housing finance company (HFCs) and microfinance institutions (MFIs) were too trading higher by up to 6% on the BSE on hopes of improving liquidity situation.
Shriram Transport Finance, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL), Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services, Equitas Holdings and LIC Housing Finance were up in the range of 3% to 6% on the BSE.
As regards to NBFCs, the brokerage firm believes while the liquidity situation has been improving over the past two months, higher cost of funds and slowdown in growth will impact the sector as a whole.
“We believe the impact will be particularly pronounced for wholesale financiers. HFCs with better parentage and higher share of pure retail home loans would have easier access to debt capital, in our view. Also, vehicle financiers have better pricing power, and thus, should be able to largely manage spreads in this environment. The RBI and government have been taking steps to improve the situation, which should address investor concerns,” it added.

A high-level delegation, led by AFD country director Bruno Bosle, met Energy Secretary N. Srikant recently and held discussions on the scope for investing in the power sector, an official release here said.
Tapping solar power
Mr. Srikant said the government was contemplating establishing a 10,000 MW solar power project for supplying power to the agriculture sector, for which 50,000 acres had been identified in Kadapa, Kurnool, Anantapur and Prakasam districts.
This would earn the distinction for A.P. as the first State to undertake such a project exclusively for the farm sector.
Besides, the State government intended to introduce cutting-edge technologies across power generation, transmission and distribution chain, and sought the cooperation of AFD in providing technical assistance for scaling the operations.
Mr. Srikant further said that high electricity costs and interruptions in power supply were acting as a disincentive to investment and hampering competitiveness. Keeping that in view, the government preferred low-cost power.
Officials of the Energy Department told the visiting dignitaries that the purchase of renewable power at high prices imposed a huge financial burden on the Discoms, which incurred a loss of ₹29,000 crore by the end of 2019.
The Discoms are taking loans from financial institutions such as IREDA and A.P. Power Finance Corporation for paying their dues to the renewable energy generators. The government has, therefore, resolved to bring down the costs.
The AFD team said it was keen on supporting the projects that help in mitigating the impact of climate change and have the potential to generate long-term positive impact on the quality of life.
AP-Transco Joint Managing Directors K.V.N. Chakradhar Babu and K. Venkateswara Rao, and Director (Grid & Transmission) K. Praveen Kumar were among those present.

Though there is a dip in loan assets during the quarter, we have achieved a YoY growth of 9% in loan assets at Rs 63,444 crore. High frequency indicators suggest recovery in economic activity, with strong urban demand environment though the rural demand is still reviving. The Indian economy has been resilient and we are optimistic about steady demand conditions for gold loans coupled with the huge untapped opportunity in gold loan segment. The RBI approval for opening new 150 branches, coupled with the recent digital initiatives, gold Loan@home service will help us further expand and tap new customers.
George Alexander Muthoot, managing director, Muthoot Finance said, The impact of the very low interest rate teaser loans has resulted in lower yields during Q1 FY23. The launching of teaser loans was a strategic move taken in Q3 FY22 and it enabled us to attract a set of new high value customers. Although our live number of customers is 50 Lakh, we have a customer base of more than 4 to 5 times this number, who have had earlier transacted with us. Certainly these customers will come back to Muthoot for availing the high quality service we offer them when they require credit.

In her Budget speech on July 5, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman offered a limited-period lifeline: A one-time partial guarantee by the government to state-run banks for the first loss up to 10 percent, in acquiring up to $1 trillion highly rated assets of NBFCs. Although this is a measure to instil confidence among banks to start lending to NBFCs again, there is no guarantee it will happen, as banks remain reluctant.
“Only when banks start to lend directly from their balance sheets will the scenario actually improve for NBFCs,” says Umesh G Revankar, managing director and CEO of Shriram Transport Finance Company (STFC). A leading financer of pre-owned trucks and cars, STFC borrowed through the bond markets (30 percent), bank loans (20.5 percent) and securitisation (20.2 percent) in FY19.Cost of funds for several NBFCs—most of them housing finance companies—continues to be high, and in a scenario where credit offtake is weak, so will lending activity. Consumption continues to be weak for automobiles and consumer durables there has been a fall in loans sanctioned in 28 of 35 categories for NBFCs between January and March 2019, compared to a year earlier, based on data from the Finance Industry Development Council (FIDC) and credit bureau CRIF.
Data released in July this year show auto sales falling for the third successive month in June, by 12.34 percent, to 19,97,952 units. With auto makers struggling, lenders to the sector will also continue to see sluggish growth.
“We are enablers. If original equipment manufacturers’ volume growth is lower than previous years, then the enablers’ growth cannot be more [than theirs],” says Ramesh Iyer, managing director of Mahindra Finance, one of the leading lenders for passenger and commercial vehicles, and tractors. It expects the pace of growth for pre-owned vehicles and construction equipment to pick up on their balance sheet in coming years.
Raman Aggarwal, chairman of FIDC, the industry lobby for NBFCs, believes the scenario could improve over the next two quarters: “Credit offtake is weak, but if borrowings are weak so will be lending.”

The company, had earlier invested USD 50 million in Yes Bank and USD 75 million in PNB Housing Finance through instruments that would qualify as green bonds but were floated before the SEBI circular of May 30, it said.

""This partnership with IFC will further diversify our funding profile and demonstrates the strength of our project appraisal and risk assessment capabilities for renewable energy lending,"" said L&T Infrastructure Finance Chief Executive Virender Pankaj.

Advent and Carlyle have applied to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for one board seat each, said people with knowledge of the matter. The RBI has given in-principle approval for the investments, they said.
The bank has called for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on August 24 to seek shareholder approval for increasing the authorised share capital, consequent alterations to the capital clause of the memorandum of association and an amendment to the Articles of Association along with the preferential allotment. Also to be approved are the appointment of former RBI deputy governor R Gandhi as independent director.
Extension of Prashant Kumar’s tenure as interim MD and CEO along with remuneration is also on the agenda. ET was the first to report on February 4 and March 4 about Advent and Carlyle being in discussions with Yes Bank for a potential $1 billion investment. On July 22, ET reported that the announcement was imminent as the banking regulator had approved the transaction.
Yes Bank ended Friday at ₹14.94, up 2.47%, with a market capitalisation of ₹37,432 crore on the BSE. The stock has appreciated 14.5% in the past month in anticipation of the transaction.
Following the deal, SBI stake will fall to just above 26% from 30% now and upon conversion of the warrants it will hold 23% in the bank. The core capital of the bank measured in terms of tier I capital will improve to 14.5% from 11.9% at present.
“India’s banking sector is at an inflection point where tech-enabled banks like Yes Bank have an advantage,” said Advent managing partner Shweta Jalan. “This investment also demonstrates our commitment to the country.”
“This is a testimony to the inherent strength of the bank’s franchise,” said Yes Bank CEO Kumar. “We are excited about the incremental opportunities that this partnership creates.”",pass,ambiguous

The firms have priced $2.1 billion of dollar bonds. They are joining borrowers globally that have been rushing to credit markets, after yields crashed following cash-boosting measures by authorities to keep economies afloat amid the pandemic.
State Bank of India, regarded as a proxy for the sovereign in the international debt markets, sold $600 million of notes. The state-run lender priced the deal at 140 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, its tightest spread since 2004.
Thanks to strong demand for debt globally as investors put cash to work, Indian companies have been able to tap the market even amid an uneven rebound in Asia’s third-largest economy. Growth contracted 7.5% in the three months through September, after a record 24% slump in the April-June period.
For now, money managers have focused more on the signs that the economy may be putting the worst behind it, following unprecedented stimulus. Dollar-denominated bonds from Indian issuers returned 4.7% last quarter, the most among Asia’s major economies, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes.

LIC had bought ₹13,000 crore of RIL's bonds, the sources said.
The insurance sector giant is also said to have deployed funds in a September bond sale by another highly-rated NBFC - L&T Finance, the sources said.
Japan's 40-year government bond yield declined for a fourth consecutive session, reaching its lowest point since January 9. This dip was attributed to strong demand from foreign investors, who have been actively purchasing super-long-dated bonds. Shorter-maturity yields also fell as expectations for an early Bank of Japan interest rate hike diminished.
An email sent to LIC did not receive a response by the time of publication. RIL, Tata Capital Financial Services and L&T Finance also did not respond to emails sent by ET seeking comments on the matter.
On November 9, RIL sold 10-year AAA-rated non-convertible debentures worth ₹20,000 crore, marking the largest-ever bond sale by an Indian firm that is not in the financial sector. The coupon rate, or the interest paid out to investors, for RIL's bonds was set at 7.79%.
""We have shifted our focus to non-par products,"" LIC chairman Siddhartha Mohanty had told ET in a recent interview. ""We have our strategy as to how we can earn beyond G-sec in NCDs depending on the quality of the paper.""
Currently, LIC holds a 22% share of the overall bond and 4% of the total market capitalisation in Indian equity. Of the total investment of ₹47.5 lakh crore, ₹11 lakh crore to ₹12 lakh crore is invested in equity. LIC has seen a 50% increase in the share of non-par, growing from 7.12% in March 2021 to 10.7% in September 2023. LIC wants to increase the share of non-par in the annualised premium equivalent to 15%.
Hunt for Yields
""LIC has been growing some of its non-par book which requires a good yield portfolio,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, head of financial services research at Macquarie Capital. ""So one of the reasons why LIC could be investing in corporate bonds is to offer high returns on guaranteed products.""
TCFSL, on December 6, carried out a sale of secured, redeemable, 10-year non-convertible debentures worth ₹2,500 crore, with the coupon rate being set at 8.11%, sources said.
""There is a pattern to LIC's investments; they typically want 1.25 times asset coverage from a company before investing. The pricing of the deal shows the presence of a single large investor; moreover, the market would have difficulty in absorbing deals of such sizes,"" a source said on condition of anonymity.
""LIC also requires highly rated corporate bonds and from an investment perspective a deal at 8.11% is a good one. If one looks at PSU names to invest in, one will have to go down the ladder and accept a rate of around 7.70% or so,"" the source said.
The bond sale by L&T Finance was carried out on September 12, with the NBFC issuing ₹1,600 crore worth of 10-year AAA-rated non-convertible debentures.

Jet Airways: An ongoing probe against Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal has revealed that the grounded carrier entered into illegal agreements with related offshore parties based in tax havens at rates way above market prices, causing losses to the airline as well as the national exchequer.

Indiabulls Housing Finance: Moody's has downgraded Indiabulls Housing Finance’s corporate family rating and the home financier’s foreign-currency senior secured rating to B2 from Ba2. Meanwhile, the NBFC will consult Sebi about its eligibility to buy back shares given the regulations on the ideal capital structure.
Wipro: Analysts tracking the IT major have estimated a 3-4 per cent drop in sequential profit due to lower other income. They see revenue rising 1-2 per cent QoQ in constant currency (CC) terms, much in line with the company’s 0-2 per cent revenue guidance for the quarter. Margins may see some pressure due to wage hikes, they said.
Adani Gas: French energy giant Total will buy 37.4 per cent stake in Adani Gas, marking another big-ticket entry of a global major in India’s energy market after Shell and BP which are already in India, and Reliance Industries Ltd’s talks for a possible sale of 20 per cent of its core oil-to-chemicals division to Saudi Aramco.

India Grid InvIT Fund, IRB InvIT Fund and IndInfravit: Banks will now be allowed to lend to InvITs or infrastructure investment trusts. The sanctioning of these loans, however, would be subject to tighter parameters of scrutiny such as having board-approved policies on exposures, compliance with prescribed leverage ratios and tighter underwriting norms for SPV-linked funds.
