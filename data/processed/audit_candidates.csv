New Delhi: Piramal Enterprises will join JSW Steel and its Japanese business partner JFE Steel Corp to bid for debt-laden Bhushan Steel, a source privy to the development said.
As per initial plans, JFE Steel will keep over 50 percent stake in the business and the rest will be divided between JSW Steel and Piramal Enterprises, the source said.
""JSW Steel along with JFE Steel and Piramal Enterprises will bid for Bhushan Steel. JSW Steel will keep minority stake with itself, some will be with Piramal and a majority say over 50-60 per cent will be with JFE Steel but the operational power will be with the steelmaker,"" the source said while requesting anonymity.

ORDER SHEET A.P. No. 1143 of 2017 IN THE HIGH COURT AT CALCUTTA Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction ORIGINAL SIDE TATA CAPITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD. Versus KAMAL SEIKH & ANR. BEFORE: The Hon'ble JUSTICE ASHIS KUMAR CHAKRABORTY Date : 25th January, 2018. For Petitioner : Mr. S. Banerjee with Ms. Archana Chowdhury, Advs. This is an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 as amended by the Amending Act 3 of 1996. From the affidavit of service filed on behalf of the petitioner, it appears that the copies of this application were served upon both the respondents by way of Registered
Post. However, none appears on behalf of any of the respondents to oppose this application. Let the affidavit of service be kept with the record.
It is the case of the petitioner that in terms of the agreement dated November 17, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as 'the said agreement') the respondent no.1 obtained a loan of Rs.19,90,000/- and acquired a JCB 3DX construction equipment mentioned in paragraph 4 of the application. The said equipment remains hypothecated in favour of the petitioner. The respondent no.2 as the guarantor, is a party to the said agreement which also contains an arbitration clause.
Although under the said agreement, the respondent no.1 was obliged to repay the amount financed by the petitioner together with the agreed rate of interest and other charges by 44 instalments of Rs.56,805/- each, but after paying the first 9 instalments 2 and part of 10th instalment, he failed to pay the balance instalments. In spite of being called upon, the respondents failed to repay the dues of the petitioner or to make over possession of the hypothecated asset to the petitioner. Therefore, the petitioner has terminated the said agreement and filed this application to enforce its rights against the hypothecated asset, presently lying in the district of Birbhum of the State of West Bengal.
According to the petitioner, as on December 9, 2017 there remains an amount of Rs.17,93,825.65 due and owing by the respondents to the petitioner.
Accordingly, Ms. Anima Chakraborty, Advocate of Bar Association Room No.3, is appointed as the Receiver with a direction upon her to take actual physical possession of the hypothecated asset. After taking possession of the hypothecated asset the Receiver shall keep the same, in her custody, at a safe place to be provided by the petitioner.
The Receiver shall be paid an initial remuneration of 1300 GMs by the petitioner. The petitioner shall also bear the travelling expenses of the Receiver and shall provide her with befitting accommodation(s) at the relevant places in the State of West Bengal. Needless to mention that a competent officer of the petitioner shall all along accompany the Receiver in the State of West Bengal.
If necessary, the Receiver shall approach the Superintendent of Police of the concerned District for obtaining police assistance to implement this order. If the petitioner deposits the requisite fees with the concerned authorities, the Superintendent of Police of the concerned district shall render necessary police assistance to the Receiver 3 to take actual physical possession of the hypothecated asset from the concerned respondent.
Let this application appear after three weeks from date.
The Receiver shall file her report on the next date of hearing. Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be made available to the parties subject to compliance with the requisite formalities.
All parties, including the Receiver and the concerned police authorities shall act on a copy of the photostat certified copy of this order.

The offer got 72.19% votes from the committee of creditors, Reliance Industries and Alok Industries said in stock-exchange filings.
The favourable voting brings fresh hope to employees and operational creditors of Alok Industries, which was otherwise set to enter liquidation.
This was the second time the committee was considering the bid by Reliance and JM Financial ARC.
On 12 April, Reliance Industries said it had submitted a joint bid, along with JM Financial ARC, for debt-laden Alok Industries. The two had offered to pay Rs 5,000 crore. Alok Industries owes lenders Rs 29,614 crore.
The plan was rejected by the committee of creditors as 30% of the votes were against it and 70% for it. The minimum vote needed in favour of the resolution was 75%.
However, a recent ordinance issued by the government to amend the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has brought down the threshold to 66% from 75% earlier in order for the committee of creditors to approve a resolution plan.
The 270-day time frame for insolvency resolution had ended on 14 April. The committee, after voting against the plan, decided to opt for liquidation. This was challenged by the employees and operational creditors of Alok Industries in the NCLT.
Last week, the Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT asked the committee of creditors to re-evaluate the previously rejected bid.
The ordinance does not apply to old cases; hence, fresh voting was called for in the case of Alok Industries.
Alok Industries had reported a net loss of Rs 3,502 crore on revenue of Rs 8,326 crore for 2016-17. For the October-December quarter of 2017-18, its net loss stood at Rs 4,745 crore on revenue of Rs 952 crore, according to stock-exchange data.

""Pursuant to the voting, the Resolution Plan has received the assent of 72.192 per cent of the voting share of the CoC,"" RIL said in a regulatory filing.
The committee of creditors of Alok Industries had earlier rejected Reliance's resolution plan for acquiring the firm in partnership with JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company. RIL-JM Financial ARC was the sole bidder and its initial offer of Rs 4,950 crore in April was rejected on the grounds that it was too low.
According to a report in The Economic Times, RIL-JM Financial improved its bid by Rs 100 crore in second round and offered to pay Rs 5,050 crore -- an amount which is 83 per cent less than the total dues of Rs 29,500 crore.
Under the IBC, a resolution plan needs approval from at least 66 per cent of the lenders to be eligible for the next stage, which is the NCLT's approval. In a regulatory filing to the exchanges, RIL said: ""We have been informed that our plan did not meet with the approval of the Committee of Creditors of Alok Industries as required under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.""
Last year in July, the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal had admitted insolvency proceedings against Alok Industries under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Alok Industries was among the 12 companies on RBI's first list. A consortium of lenders led by SBI is claiming dues of over Rs 23,000 crore from the beleaguered textile company.
Earlier in May 25, Alok Industries had informed that the resolution professional of the company has filed an application before the NCLT for liquidation of the company and no order has been passed by it.

Moody's said Yes Bank will continue to outpace the industry in loan book growth, but added that while the capital buffers are adequate for now
Moody's Investors Service Thursday affirmed the ratings of Yes Bank, a day after RBI curtailed term of the midsize private lender's promoter chief executive Rana Kapoor.
The rating agency has also maintained the outlook on the ratings as stable.
""Yes Bank's profitability is strong, and Moody's expects that the bank can maintain low credit costs over the next 12-18 months,"" the global rating agency said in a note.
It added that the growth in both the interest and non-interest income will help the city-headquartered bank maintain ""solid profitability"".
The agency warned that while the bank's current asset quality metrics are strong and superior to that of peers, its ""aggressive growth strategy poses asset risks"".

The overall issuer rating, accordingly continues to stand at Baa3, it said, adding that all the other ratings on the bank have been affirmed.
The bank informed last evening that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had curtailed the term of Rana Kapoor, its promoter, chief executive and managing director, till January 31, 2019, and asked the board to find a replacement. The 61-year-old Kapoor owns over 10 per cent in the bank.
Private sector bank chiefs are allowed to continue holding their posts till the age of 70. In August, the bank board had given a three-year extension to Kapoor and sought the central bank's go-ahead for the same.
The bank had been found to have under reported non-performing assets (NPAs) by over Rs 100 billion for two consecutive years.
Moody's said Yes Bank will continue to outpace the industry in loan book growth, but added that while the capital buffers are adequate for now, it will have to raise capital from the market soon.
It said the bank's share in the system-wide assets has increased five times to 2.4 per cent since 2009, which ""underpins"" its belief that the government will support it in case needed, and added that its ""importance to the Indian banking system is increasing"".
If the bank is able to maintain the present asset quality ratios and reduce credit risk concentrations, its share of low-cost Casa (current account savings account) deposits improves without affecting the margins and profitability is sustained, the agency said the bank's rating can move up.
However, an increase in NPAs or decline in earnings can lead to a downgrade in ratings, it said.

Panic and grief gripped investors as shares of YES Bank, the country’s third-largest private lender, crashed by 30 per cent. An even bigger crash – of 60 per cent – in the share price of DHFL, the three-decade-old home financier, spread further chaos. The Sensex tumbled by 1,100 points intraday and the Nifty by more than 350 points or over 3 per cent. Although the Sensex recovered sharply before closing at 36,841.60, down 279.62 points, YES Bank saw no pullback and closed at ₹227 on the BSE, down 28.71 per cent, after touching an intra-day low of ₹210. The broader NSE Nifty shed 91.25 points to finish at 11,143.10.
Uncertainty at YES Bank
The ongoing debt woes of Mumbai-based Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Service (IL&FS) sparked a vicious sell-off of commercial paper by finance companies to meet redemptions. Yet, it’s the uncertainty at YES Bank that has market experts worried in the short run.
“Friday’s fall is about YES Bank, where institutional investors hold 45 per cent. The 30 per cent crash was a shocker, and people are wondering what will transpire at the banks board meet next Tuesday,” said Rahul Arora, CEO, Institutional Equities, Nirmal Bang.
Arora said the street was caught offguard by the RBI’s move to oust YES Bank founder-promoter Rana Kapoor from the board.
DHFL shares closed at ₹351, down 42.42 per cent. The sell-off came following news that DSP Mutual Fund had offloaded DHFL debt papers worth ₹200-300 crore for an 11 per cent yield when the prevailing yield was well below 10 per cent, sparking concerns of a fire sale. Even when the DSP management clarified that it had done so to meet redemption pressure due to its high exposure to IL&FS debt, markets reckoned that the yield for other NBFC papers too would go up.
DHFL Chairman & Managing Director Kapil Wadhawan said the company “has not defaulted on any bonds or repayment nor has there been any single instance of delay on any of its repayment of any liability. Our fundamentals are strong and we hold liquidity of about ₹10,000 crore, equivalent to six months’ cash.”

The Centre plans to sell stake in hydropower producer SJVN and Power Finance Corporation to other public sector companies to net close to Rs 20,000 crore to help maintain its FY19 fiscal deficit target, sources told Bloomberg.
The government will sell its 63.8 percent stake in SJVN to NTPC, India’s largest thermal power producer, to garner close to Rs 8,000 crore, while Rural Electrification Corporation will acquire 65.6 percent stake in PFC.
These deals showcase the government's resolve to usher consolidation in the power space.
Amit Mantri, founder of 2Point2 Capital Advisors, told the wire that this a disinvestment proxy. “By selling stake in one state-run company to another, the government can claim to have monetised its stake. But this is only an optical reduction in fiscal deficit,” he added.
The Centre has raised Rs 9,200 crore from asset sales so far, which looks feeble against its FY19 target of Rs 80,000 crore.
At 09:17 hrs Power Finance Corporation was quoting at Rs 81.50, up 0.99 percent and SJVN was quoting at Rs 27.70, down 3.99 percent on the BSE.

Gross bad loan ratio is total non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of gross advances.
Following the announcement, shares of Yes Bank rose and at 2:52 pm, they were trading at ₹ 196 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), up 6.84% from their previous close.
In a statement to the stock exchanges, Yes Bank said, over the past few days, “some unfounded speculation regarding the bank’s asset quality have been brought to its notice. In this context, management clarifies that the asset quality continues to be stable”.
The bank said that while its deposits grew 41% y-o-y to ₹ 2.23 trillion, loans and advances grew 61.5% y-o-y to ₹ 2.4 trillion in the September quarter of FY19. It added that its domestic loans saw a 56.4% y-o-y growth in the same period.
Releasing this data on financial performance ahead of the official announcement for the September quarter, it said these numbers were subject to approval by the audit committee of the board and review by the statutory auditors of the bank.
On succession planning, the bank said the two external experts of the ‘search and selection committee’ would be finalized by 7 October. The committee, it said, would be assisted by a global leadership advisory firm that would evaluate both internal and external candidates and make suitable recommendations to the board of directors for submission to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
The lender also said that the bank had submitted its application to the RBI for its approval on appointing two senior bankers – Rajat Monga and Pralay Mondal – as executive directors.
Mint reported on 1 October that Yes Bank’s decision to request the regulator to extend Managing Director Rana Kapoor’s tenure was not in the best interests of the lender, citing a letter by Madhu Kapur, widow of co-founder Ashok Kapur and the bank’s second largest shareholder, to the board.
On 25 September, the board of Yes Bank had said it would ask the RBI to extend Kapoor’s tenure by eight months. The board decided it would first seek an extension for Kapoor till 30 April 2019 for finalization of financial statements for the year to 31 March, and thereafter a further extension till 30 September for completing the annual general meeting process.
The bank’s board decided on the course of action after the RBI agreed to extend Kapoor’s tenure till 31 January 2019 in response to the bank’s request for a three-year extension till 31 August 2021.",pass,sample

(Reuters) - India's Yes Bank Ltd on Wednesday said the Reserve Bank of India had reaffirmed that the retail bank should appoint a successor to Chief Executive Rana Kapoor by February 1, 2019.
Last month, the central bank said Kapoor could only stay in his job until Jan. 31 without specifying a reason, even though Yes Bank's shareholders' had agreed to extend his term for three years.
The lender's shares had dropped about thirty percent on the news.
Yes Bank then asked for central bank approval to extend Kapoor's term beyond January to allow more time to find a replacement. But the central bank has stuck with its deadline for a new CEO.
The Reserve Bank's action highlights its increasingly proactive approach to tackling the problems in India's banking sector caused mainly by bad debts.

Kapoor, viewed as a charismatic business leader and one of India's most prominent bankers, co-founded Yes Bank in 2004 and has been instrumental in creating the country's fifth largest private sector bank by assets.
But Yes Bank's rapid expansion came at a cost of rising bad loans - a problem plaguing the Indian banking industry.
The bank has hired advisory firm Korn Ferry to help to search for Kapoor's successor.
The bank aims to complete the recruitment process by mid-December, Yes Bank said in a statement after markets closed on Wednesday. Its shares fell nearly 7 percent in a broader Mumbai market that ended 1.2 percent lower.

Indiabulls Housing Finance (IBHFL) reported a profit of Rs 1,044.1 crore for the second quarter of the current fiscal, up 21.2 percent over the year-ago period. The company's profit after tax (PAT) was Rs 861.3 crore during July-September quarter of 2017-18.
The total revenue was Rs 4,255.27 crore in the second quarter compared to Rs 3,452.45 crore in the year-ago period. A release of the IBHFL said the company closed September 2018 with cash and liquid investments of Rs 21,249.7 crore.
Reacting to the results, JPMorgan maintained its overweight rating on Indiabulls Housing Finance with a target price of Rs 1600 post Q2 results which translate into an upside of 68 percent from Monday’s closing price of Rs 948.70.
It was yet another consistent quarterly earnings delivered by the company. The asset liability management (ALM) is conservative and the company should be able to ride out current stress in money markets, the report added. It is the top pick of JPMorgan in the NBFC space.
Here’s what other brokerage firms are recommending:
Macquarie: Outperform| Target: Rs 1400
Macquarie maintained an outperform rating on Indiabulls Housing Finance with a target price of Rs 1400 post Q2 results. The September quarter numbers were largely in-line with estimates and there are no concerns on the liquidity front as well.
The growth might slow down as the management has cut loan growth guidance for FY19 to 20 percent. Macquarie says that the liquidity concerns are overdone, and the recent correction is an opportunity to ‘add’.
CLSA: Buy| Cut target to Rs 1500
CLSA maintained its buy rating on Indiabulls Housing Finance post Q2 results but slashed its target price to Rs 1500 from Rs 1700 earlier, but it still represents an upside of 58 percent from current levels.
It was a steady quarter for Indiabulls Housing. The liquidity is high but growth is likely to moderate. The global investment bank slashed its earnings estimate by 3%-5% to factor weaker top-line.

The global rating agency lowered Yes Bank’s foreign and local currency bank deposit ratings to Ba1 from Baa3. It also downgraded Yes Bank’s baseline credit assessment (BCA) to Ba2 from Ba1.
Moody’s also downgraded the foreign currency senior unsecured medium-term note (MTN) programme rating and senior unsecured debt rating.
The rating action considers the resignation of members of the bank’s board and the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) September directive to restrict the term of the bank’s founder and managing director Rana Kapoor, Moody’s said. This has raised concerns over corporate governance, the rating company said.
On Wednesday, the Press of India reported the sparring promoters of Yes Bank are inching towards a truce, but there was no clarity on the exact status of the talks with one camp claiming it’s at an advanced stage and the other being not on the same page.
Moody’s also changed the outlook to negative from stable. However, it affirmed the bank’s counterparty risk assessment and domestic and foreign currency counter-party risk rating.
“In Moody’s opinion, although the bank’s reported credit fundamentals remain stable, the developments surrounding the transition in leadership as well as the governance issues are credit negative because they complicate management’s effective implementation of the bank’s long-term strategy. Furthermore, these developments could constrain the bank’s ability to raise new capital,” it said.
The revision in rating follows the resignation of three board members of Yes Bank in quick succession. R. Chandrashekhar, one of the board members, even expressed his displeasure over recent events at the bank and disappointment at the manner in which the lender handled them. Yes Bank is currently in the midst of a management change after RBI cut short the tenure of Kapoor as the chief executive officer.
Separately, Mint had reported on Monday that RBI is inspecting Yes Bank’s exposure to Infrastructure Leasing and Housing Finance Ltd, Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL), Indiabulls Group and Sudhir Valia-promoted entities. The inspection is to ascertain whether there is any link between the bank and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) in the backdrop of the Infrastructure Leasing and Housing Finance Ltd crisis.
Moody’s also highlighted the divergence in Yes Bank’s reported asset quality compared with the RBI’s assessment of asset quality in the two fiscal years ended March 2017 and 2016.
“While its current asset quality metrics are superior to those of its Indian peers, its aggressive growth strategy poses asset risks,” the ratings agency noted.

The resignations, when seen in conjunction with RBI’s September directive to restrict the term of the bank's MD & CEO Rana Kapoor, till January 31, 2019, have raised concerns over corporate governance, the rating agency said.
Global financial services firm UBS has maintained a ‘Sell’ on YES Bank with a price target of Rs 150. “Post correction the stock appears cheap. However, NPL recognition has yet to take place,” UBS said. It expects GNPL to rise to 5 per cent by FY20.
Moreover, the Indian lender tumbled in the dollar bond market as well.
“There are multiple reasons clouding Yes Bank, and they don't seem to fade away so early, even if the stock price has halved. If you look at the stock price, which recently jumped in last month from Rs 180 to Rs 250 levels is back at its lower levels. This is a clear indication of distribution at upper levels. The stock below Rs 160 will be looking to drift further to Rs 133 level. It is better to be risk averse than to come out and take it,” said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO of Epic Research in a note.

The company remains confident to be able to monetise some of these assets over the next two quarters and bring down the debt significantly, Reliance Capital said in a filing to stock exchanges.
The rating continues to factor RCap’s experienced management, well-diversified and growing business profile of companies (subsidiaries and associates) in the financial services segment, it said.
Shares of Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group’s three listed companies, including Reliance Capital, witnessed a sharp decline last week following sale of pledged shares by L&T Finance and Edelweiss Group.
Lenders said that Reliance Group failed to make timely payments leading to sale of pledged shares. (PTI)

Anil Ambani group’s $1-billion stake in Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management (AMC), people directly aware of the matter said. Reliance Capital and Nippon Life equally own 42.88% stake each in the company, managing assets worth over Rs 4.14 lakh crore as of December end.
Reliance Capital, which has management control, last week offered its stake to Nippon Life after deciding to exit the asset management business.
While Nippon was keen on retaining its holding in the asset manager, it is not certain whether it wants to buy the whole or part of the shares offered. Sources said Nippon might decide against building up a large stake, opening up the fray for financial investors.
At the current market value, the Reliance Capital shares are worth more than Rs 5,000 crore, though a control deal would come at a premium. Sources said Reliance has sought a valuation with the IPO price of Rs 252 apiece as the benchmark, pushing the deal size to about Rs 7,000 crore, or $1 billion. Shares of Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management had jumped 6% by close of Friday’s trade on the BSE to Rs 198 apiece.
ADIA, with an asset size of over $800 billion, possibly owns a part of the 14% public shareholding in Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management. But this could not be confirmed immediately. Middle East sovereign wealth managers — including those of Qatar and Dubai — have been bullish on financial services opportunities in Asia’s third-largest economy.
When contacted, a Reliance spokesperson said, “Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management is a flagship business and this is a rare opportunity for any investors to participate and share in the overall growth story of India and its rapidly expanding asset management industry.” ADIA, Investment Corporation of Dubai and QIA could not be reached for immediate comments over the weekend.
“Reliance Capital’s offer to Nippon Life was made because of the strong ties and goodwill between the two groups. Nippon otherwise has no special rights on Reliance shares. It is for Nippon to make up its mind and respond to the approach,” one of the sources cited earlier in the report said. “Nippon is happy with the investment and will certainly hold on to the current stake,” the source added.
The Japanese insurer also holds 49% stake in Reliance Nippon Life Insurance JV.
Reliance Capital decided to divest the asset management stake as part of a corporate-restructuring exercise aimed at focusing on other opportunities such as health insurance. The deal, because of change in control, would trigger an open offer to public shareholders under markets regulator Sebi’s guidelines.",pass,sample

(DHFL) has expressed concern over ratings agency ICRA’s downgrade of the company’s commercial paper (CP), calling the move unwarranted and not based on merit.
‘No material event’
“This comes barely three weeks after the company was downgraded and kept on watch by all the ratings agencies. Since then, no material event has taken place which would have compelled the ratings agency to review the ratings in less than a month’s time,” Kapil Wadhawan, chairman and managing director of DHFL, said.
DHFL’s shares plunged 8% on Tuesday and another 2% on Wednesday.
DHFL said it was surprising that ICRA did not consider the company’s commitment towards its obligations through sustained efforts, including asset sale and reduced CP exposures. Also, DHFL’s progress towards fund-raising transactions was not taken into consideration. Following the stake sale of Aadhar, the company’s affordable housing finance arm, DHFL has sufficient cash reserves and investments today are equivalent to about ₹4,500 crore.
“With regard to liquidity, almost ₹13,000 crore of the portfolio is available for sell-down right now, if we were to exercise that option,” Mr. Wadhawan said.
₹7,000 cr. payout
“Overall, the company has nearly ₹33,000 crore of retail portfolio with required seasoning. At the same time, in the next six months, we have almost ₹7,000 crore of payout, which the company can comfortably manage with inflows of more than ₹2,000 crore per month from the regular EMI/PMIs.”
He added that DHFL was looking for a strategic partner and an announcement would be made as soon as a development was finalised.
Mr. Wadhawan said that DHFL had extinguished almost 98% of its commercial papers and cleared obligations worth almost ₹18,000 crore till December 31, 2018. This included ₹9,965 crore of commercial papers.
“We will take all remedial measures to protect the interests of all our stakeholders and continue to service all our obligations as we have done in this industry crisis since September 2018,” the chairman said.

DHFL’s audit committee in its meeting on January 31 had appointed chartered accountant firm TP Ostwal & Associates as an independent expert to carry out an in-depth review and independently verify data relating to allegations made by Cobrapost. The firm has examined the transactions of DHFL with 26 entities for loans aggregating to Rs 11,522 crore (Rs 10,960 crore per the company's records).

Time horizon given by the brokerage is one year.
View of the brokerage-
Deceleration in disbursement growth and near-term uncertainty weighing on AUM growth: CIFC’s disbursement growth decelerated sharply to 11 per cent yoy in Q4 FY19 from 26 per cent yoy in 9m FY19.
This led to overall AUM growth coming-off to 26 per cent yoy from 29 per cent yoy in the preceding quarter.
However, one would have expected CIFC to have fared better considering strong positioning in rural/semi-urban markets, well-diversified product portfolio (including 25 per cent share of used vehicle and refinance) and opportunity to grab market from liquidity-constrained NBFCs.
In the Home Equity (HE) business, there was a material pick-up in disbursements (growth at 28 per cent yoy v/s 18 per cent yoy for 9m FY19) which led to stabilization of AUM growth at 15-16 per cent yoy despite elevated run-offs.
In the wake of uncertainty stemming from elections and monsoon, the management was averse to paint a buoyant growth picture for FY20.
In VF segment, it expects a 15 per cent disbursement growth (could be upgraded later based on BS-VI pre-buying trend) and in HE business, CIFC expects a 15 per cent AUM growth. The company is better-positioned than most other NBFCs on the liquidity front.
Stable NIM, spike in opex and improvement in asset quality: CIFC’s NIM was flat qoq at 6.8 per cent; both funding cost and portfolio yield inched up 10-20bps qoq.
The company has been carrying a substantially higher cash balance since Dec 2018. In VF segment, the NIM sequentially improved by 40bps to 7.6 per cent driven by lending rate hikes taken in the past six months across products.
In HE business, NIM dipped 40bps qoq as income yield contracted due to lower upfront assignment income (Rs120mn v/s 310mn in Q3 FY19). Opex ratio climbed to 2.9 per cent in Q4 on account of investment being incurred on branch additions.
CIFC plans to add about 100 branches (FY19 base of 900) in Q1 FY20, and the company has recruited resources to straightaway kick-start their operations.
The company’s Gross and Net Stage-3 assets declined by 12-16 per cent qoq with their ratio falling by 40-50bps on sequential basis. As per I-GAAP, the Net NPL ratio at 1.1 per cent was at an all-time low.
Such sharp correction in asset quality was driven by seasonally stronger collections in VF business and encouraging NPL recoveries in HE segment realized through the SARFAESI process.
The credit cost in both business segments declined by 40-50bps qoq. The mild fall in ECL coverage on Stage 1 & 2 assets can be construed to be driven by an improvement in early bucket collections.
Macro uncertainty and near-full valuation caps upside: CIFC has historically demonstrated impressive growth and asset quality resilience through challenging phases.
While the next couple of years could mark a sluggish period for VF business; the HE portfolio would likely improve on its growth rate with resurrection of operating model compete.
In our view, NIM should stabilize as the company possesses the ability to pass-on any durable increase in funding cost.
Credit cost should trend steadily if the monsoon is satisfactory and fuel cost remains under control. Post factoring conservative assumptions on growth and asset quality front, we estimate CIFC to deliver 15-16 per cent earnings CAGR over FY19-21. The company trades at 2.9x FY21 P/ABV.

It also stopped renewals and put premature withdrawals from existing fixed deposits on hold.
However, it allowed withdrawals in case of medical emergencies. The DHFL management said that it took these measures to manage the liquidity crunch and navigate through multiple downgrades by credit evaluators on its debt instruments.
Four days earlier, CARE Ratings had downgraded DHFL's FD programme worth Rs 20,000 crore from ‘A’ to ‘BBB-‘. CARE A signifies “low” credit risk, while CARE BBB- signifies “moderate” credit risk.
Over the past decade or two, we have heard numerous instances of company FDs defaulting or postponing their payments. How big is the FD market?
According to the National Housing Bank, there are 18 housing finance companies (HFCs), including DHFL, that are allowed to accept public deposits.
These HFCs have raised Rs 1.22 lakh crore from public deposits as on March 2018, as per Reserve Bank of India’s ‘Trends and Progress in Banking’ report for 2018.
The RBI states that besides these HFCs, 89 non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) have a licence to raise money from the public through FDs. These have raised Rs 32,600 crore in FDs as on September 2018.
Apart from these, and as per data from CARE ratings, scheduled banks and scheduled commercial banks have issued FDs totalling Rs 1.13 lakh crore and Rs 1.10 lakh crore respectively, as on March 31, 2019.
""Due to the new action by DHFL stopping premature redemptions and not taking renewals, there will be further reluctance on part of the public to commit to FD schemes of HFCs and NBFCs. This will further impair their ability to raise funds for their business,"" says Suresh Sadagopan, Founder of Ladder7 Financial Advisories.
Does that mean you should avoid all company and NBFC FDs?
Review portfolio of company FDs
In last one year, the debt portion of several companies including HFCs and NBFCs has become risky. The financials of some of the companies are under stress.
Sadagopan says, ""If this situation continues then what we see for DHFL (i.e. renewals and premature withdrawals are kept on hold by the management) can happen with other companies' FDs as well. So, periodically review your company FDs portfolio and analyse whether the investments are in risky companies in the current market situation. Then decide whether you would like to renew or withdraw investments from company FDs you have invested.""
A cursory glance through newspapers daily would give you an idea about the health of several companies that are in the news for the wrong reasons. Check if you have an FD with any such company. If the forecast looks grim, it might be wise to withdraw your investments prematurely and get out. But, do check once with your financial advisor before you take the final step.
Follow news about the company
Things change over time. The financials of your company may have looked good when invested in its FDs some years back. But over time, it is possible that the company’s financials could have deteriorated either by its own actions or merely because of downsizing or crisis in its line of business.
Sadagopan says: ""Pay attention to specific news you come across and analyse how it could impact the company’s financial performance. In case, certain news can impact the company negatively take appropriate action on your FDs with that company. You can even keep that company under the scanner to analyse periodically.""
For instance, in mid of the 1990s, a company by the name of Cable Corporation of India offered an FD scheme to investors. This was the first company to manufacture Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) cables in India at that time so it became an instant hit among FD investors.
However, in the late 90s, the power sector witnessed negative growth and the company’s order book dried up. Since its income was affected, it stopped paying regular interest and principal amounts on maturity to its FD investors. The management was selling off assets one by one without disclosing it to investors. A bit of vigilance in such scenarios helps foresee the grim future and could save you from losses.
Between 2009-12, several companies came out with high-interest FD schemes, but due to the economic slowdown defaulted in repaying investors' amounts. For instance, investors in some of Jaiprakash Associates and Unitech FDs did not receive their money on maturity.
Anup Bhaiya, MD and CEO of Money Honey Financial Services says, ""One has to look at the quality of the company and pay attention to micro and macro news which could impact the company/sector you have invested in. The first principle should be the preservation of capital for debt investors. Also, while investing in a debt instrument don’t take higher risks.""
Study the company's background and credit rating
You should research the companies’ financials while investing in an FD scheme. It is not everyone's cup of tea to scan the financial results of a company, but do try and find out. There are several online portals that help you to go through the historical financial results of the company.
Rachit Chawla, Founder and CEO of lending and investment advisory platform Finway says, ""You should analyse the management of the company and how their core competencies compare to peers. Get information about the debt on the company in the last five years. Also check historically, whether the interests were paid on time with the principal amount on maturity.""
It is important you do some research on the directors and promoters of the company. This will give you a fair idea of whether the company is secure enough for investment purposes.
Again, read the newspapers, magazines, digital news or any information about the company you can get a hold of. Well-known names that come with a track record do instil some confidence, but if the name of the company doesn’t ring a bell, it is best to do some groundwork.
You should also check the credit rating of the company before investing in that company’s FD. Joydeep Sen, founder of financial advisory firm wiseinvestor.in says, ""You should consider FD schemes from companies with AA or higher ratings (signifies safe and secure) from credit rating agencies and from reputed business groups, to have trust on the financials and intentions.""
These ratings are a measure of the company’s ability to pay the interest as well as principal to its investors, and a high rating means no or very low probability of default. Financial institutions such as CRISIL, CARE, Brickwork and ICRA rate the companies and their FDs. And while credit ratings have come under clouds due to recent events, especially since Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), they still remain one of the main parameters to judge a company’s health.
Know premature penalty charges
Typically, we recommend investments to be made for the long run. But in company FDs, it’s best to stick to a five-year term. Anything longer than this makes it tough to predict a company’s trajectory, typically. This way you can keep a watch on the company’s rating and financials. Moneycontrol recommended the same for several non-convertible debentures (NCDs) which hit the market so far this year.
As per RBI norms, an investor needs to stay invested in company FDs for a minimum lock-in period of three months. Post this lock-in, premature withdrawals are allowed from company FDs (including HFCs and NBFCs) but it attracts penalty charges which vary among companies. So, you need to be aware of it while investing.
What if the company defaults? Is your FD secured?
Although company FDs assure regular interest where there is an interest payment option and then, of course, your principal payment, they rank a notch below bank FDs as far as safety is concerned. Here’s why.
Company FDs are typically not secured against the assets of the company, so the chances of default in payment of interest and principal are significantly higher than banks.
Further, the repayment of principal and interest in the case of bank FDs are secured by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corp up to a sum of Rs 1 lakh. That’s not the case with company FDs, including those by HFCs and NBFCs. So, in your company defaults, investors have little recourse and can lose all the money including the interest in case the company defaults.
Navin Chandani, Chief Business Development Officer, of an online aggregator of financial products BankBazaar.com says, ""Make sure that the returns are realistic, typically 2-3 percent more than a bank FD of similar tenure. But if the returns are much higher, that is a red flag. Unusually, high returns on a company FD comes with greater risk.""
One of the reasons why the company offers high-interest rates is to compensate investors for its low credit rating and that is another red flag.
For instance, in 1999 and 2000 Roofit Industries and sister company Sun Earth Industries collected around Rs 72 crore from thousands of investors. These companies were offering lucrative interest rates around 15 percent per annum to lure investors in a fixed deposit scheme. These companies stopped paying regular interests and then the principal amount on maturity to FD investors from 2001. Almost, two decades have passed away but investors still haven’t received interest and principal amount from these companies. In June 2017, Roofit filed for insolvency and the case is with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT); the court set up to resolve bankruptcy proceedings.
Moneycontrol take
Not all company FDs are bad. An informed decision and cautious approach would ensure that you don’t trip over your company FDs and at the same time, earn returns higher than those you get from bank FDs. A bit of homework helps, though.
Before investing in any company FDs, carefully go through the application form, financial statements of the company and other information pertaining to the company offering the fixed deposit. Check with advisors or distributors about the company’s past interest paying track record as well.",pass,sample

""Over the last few weeks there have been several unwarranted speculation in the market about the creditworthiness of DHFL and the company stands committed to honour all its liability payments,"" one of the sources said.
DHFL stock Wednesday settled 9.85 per cent down at Rs 117.10 on the BSE.
The company has cleared liabilities of nearly Rs 30,000 crore since September 2018, the sources added.
For the past eight months, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) have been reeling under liquidity crunch against the backdrop of debt defaults by IL&FS group companies and others.
On May 10, DHFL clarified on unwarranted speculation in the market about continuous weakening of the company's credit profile.
""We would like to place on record that the slowdown in business activity in the industry has not had any adverse impact on DHFL's debt repayment ability or loan servicing and collections of the company,"" it had said.
From a servicing standpoint, collection efficiency has remained over 99 per cent every month since September 2018, DHFL had said.
On Tuesday, the RBI decided to have a specialised cadre for supervision and regulation of NBFCs and other financial institutions.
Earlier this month, Corporate Affairs Secretary Injeti Srinivas in an interview to PTI had said the NBFC sector was facing issues of credit squeeze, over-leveraging and misadventures by some large entities.
""There is an imminent crisis in the NBFC sector. There is a credit squeeze, over-leveraging, excessive concentration, massive mismatch between assets and liabilities, coupled with some misadventures by some very large entities, which is a perfect recipe for disaster,"" Srinivas had said.

In a letter to Reliance Capital, PwC said it felt compelled to withdraw from the audit of the company's fiscal year 2018-19 accounts after not receiving ""satisfactory response"" to its queries on certain observations in its assessment, Reliance Capital said in a statement late Tuesday.
Reliance Capital refuted PwC's claims and said it had duly responded to various queries of the auditor.
The resignation of auditors from one of the biggest private NBFCs in India comes at a time when bankers and investors have raised concerns of a deeper malaise in the country's shadow banking sector after shares at private home mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Ltd tanked last week following a sharp ratings downgrade.
The DHFL crisis followed the fall of one of the leading private NBFCs Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd in September which roiled the markets and spooked investors.
Reliance Capital said PwC accused it of not convening an audit committee meeting despite repeated letters and instead said it might initiate legal action against the audit firm.
PwC also warned its observations could have material impact on the company's financial statement if not resolved satisfactorily and that Reliance had prevented it from performing its duties and impaired its independent judgement.
Asked to comment on Reliance Capital's statement, PwC said it would not discuss client matters.
Reliance Capital is an NBFC owned by Anil Ambani, a business tycoon who has struggled with burgeoning debt in many of his group companies lately.

Institutional and retail investors bid for over 266 per cent of the offer size of 2.86 per cent shareholding in RNAM.
In two successive offers, Reliance Capital has sold 10.75 per cent of its shareholding in RNAM aggregating over Rs 1,450 crore and achieved the minimum public shareholding of 25 per cent in RNAM by reducing the promoter stake.
The entire RNAM stake monetisation proceeds of about Rs 6,000 crore to be received from OFS and the already announced transaction with Nippon Life Insurance Company of Japan will be utilised to reduce Reliance Capital's outstanding debt, the company said in a statement.
""As other asset monetisation deals presently underway, Reliance Capital expects to reduce its debt by at least Rs 12,000 crore (or 70 per cent) in the current financial year,"" it said. Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities India acted as selling broker for the OFS.
Reliance Capital, a part of the Reliance Group, is one of India's leading private sector financial services companies with interests in asset management and mutual funds; life, health and general insurance; commercial and home finance; stock broking; wealth management services; distribution of financial products; asset reconstruction; proprietary investments and other activities in financial services.
The company has been in controversy after Price Waterhouse & Co Chartered Accountants (PWC) resigned as statutory auditor on June 11, citing unsatisfactory response to certain observations made as a part of the ongoing audit for fiscal 2018-19.
Reliance Capital said it did not agree with the reasons given by PwC.

“So, there is adequate liquidity in the banking system. Now it is up to individual banks whom to lend to and whom not to lend to,” Mr. Parekh said.
“In the affordable housing space, we see phenomenal growth happening. High-value flats...there is a slowdown in demand in the last six months,” he added.

According to TCFS, it had a maximum exposure of Rs 165 crore to Café Coffee Day (CCD) group in FY17-18, and that the entire amount had been repaid by March 2019.
""The maximum exposure of TCFS to the CCD group during 2017-18 was Rs 165 crore. In March 2019, TCFS' exposure has completely been repaid,"" said a company statement emailed to PTI.
Currently, TCFS - a subsidiary of Tata Capital Ltd - has no exposure to Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd (CDEL) or any of the companies within the Café Coffee Day group, it added.
CDEL promoter and coffee tycoon V G Siddhartha is said to have been under severe financial stress before his death, with his flagship cafe chain's liabilities doubling to over Rs 5,200 crore by the end of March 2019. His unlisted ventures for realty and hospitality had also availed loans from various entities, as per regulatory filings with the corporate affairs ministry.
Siddhartha, whose body was recovered from a river near Mangalore on Wednesday after going missing on Monday, had struggled with mounting financial burden and a letter purportedly written by him had hinted at his war with ""serious liquidity crunch"" and ""tremendous pressure"" from lenders and an unnamed private equity investor.
Filings with the corporate affairs ministry showed him trying to raise funds by pledging shares of his listed and four unlisted firms to pay off personal and company loans. Siddhartha and promoter group entities had pledged over 75 percent of their shares in the BSE-listed CDEL as on March 31, 2019.
Siddhartha had several entities that borrowed money from a gamut of organisations, including banks and financial institutions, for his non-coffee businesses.
A letter, purportedly written by him, had cited pressure from banks, investors and tax authorities.
""I would like to say I gave it my all. I am sorry to let down all the people that put their trust in me. I fought for a long time but today, I gave up as I could not take any more pressure from one of the private equity partners forcing me to buy back shares, a transaction I had partially completed six months ago by borrowing a large sum of money from a friend,"" Siddhartha purportedly wrote in the letter.
Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd (CDEL) had a total current liability of Rs 5,251 crore as on March 31, 2019, up from Rs 2,457.3 crore a year back, according to regulatory filings.
CDEL's promoter companies -- Devadarshini Info Technologies, Coffee Day Consolidations, Gonibedu Coffee Estates, and Sivan Securities -- had also borrowed heavily from time to time.
While the exact quantum of the borrowings by the unlisted companies of Siddhartha could not be immediately ascertained, the total as indicated by the filings would be in addition to the amount CDEL owed to lenders.
Siddhartha's borrowings appear to have intensified after 2017 though there is no indication of just how many of them remain unpaid after their due date or have turned non-performing assets.

Altico Capital has received full pre-payment of Rs 250 crore loans from Phoenix Group, Hyderabad.
Phoenix is an existing development partner of Altico. Altico has funded multiple projects with Phoenix in the past and has been prepaid on multiple occasions previously. Altico had sanctioned the facility in June 2018 for the land purchase and development of an IT SEZ project forming an extension of an existing five million sq ft project a Vance Business Hub in Hitec City, the commercial business district of Hyderabad.
""This transaction, once again, underscores the robust underwriting and asset management standards followed by Altico Capital,"" said Sanjay Grewal, CEO, Altico Capital Ltd.
""For the full year FY19, like in each of the last several financial years, Altico's cash realisations far exceeded its contractual cash flows. As against contractual cash flow totalling Rs 1,500 crore for the full year FY19, we realised Rs 3,000 crore plus on a loan book of approx. Rs 7,000 crore. Post ILFS, in the last ten months, we have realised almost Rs 2,500 crore of which Rs 1,300 crore were prepayments"", stated Grewal about the exit.
""While the market for refinancing has been slow on account of the NBFC liquidity crisis, such prepayments came through multiple sources such as project cash-flows, property sales by borrowers, asset sell downs and refinancing from several newer yield-hungry FPI investors. The inflows have come from multiple loans spread across various tier 1 cities of the country. Casa Grande in Chennai, Marvel in Pune, Skylark in Bengaluru, Signature Global and Ramprastha in NCR, Manjeera in Hyderabad are few amongst many loans which resulted in prepayments and illustrate inflows from different locations and project types including residential, commercial and affordable housing. All these exits were in the mid to high teens. Altico's Q1 FY20 revenue was Rs 306 crores and PAT Rs 75 crores"", he added.
Altico will use any surplus liquidity generated to deploy in the Board approved diversification strategy, moving away from lending to only residential RE segment. 45 per cent of Altico's loan portfolio is compliant with RBI definition of infrastructure lending comprising mainly of affordable housing, IT/IT-SEZ, and warehousing/logistics.
Altico plans to further lend to infrastructure sectors such as education, hospitality, healthcare, etc. along with diversification into retail mortgage lending. With regards to wholesale diversification, the NBFC prefers asset-backed lending strategies and projects that have measurable CFs. All the sectors picked have similar characteristics similar to RE i.e. have hard assets as security and 4-5 year cash cycle that match the liability duration.

The process has been further complicated as certain bondholders have also initiated a process to take DHFL to bankruptcy court, the custodian added.
Out of the 87,000 debenture holders who had been asked to be party to the resolution plan being deliberated upon by banks, only 24,400 debenture holders, or less than 30%, had responded before the due date earlier this month.
The banks have signed an inter-creditor agreement (ICA) to come up with a plan to restructure nearly 1 trillion rupees ($14 billion) of DHFL's debt. They had been trying to get bondholders on board as well for the plan to succeed.
Under new central bank rules for resolving bad debts, it is
mandatory for 75% of lenders by value and 60% by number to sign the ICA to execute a revival plan which in DHFL's case can be achieved only with the support of bondholders.
Banks, with an exposure of just about 360 billion rupees, will need support from insurance companies, pension funds and other institutional investors to approve the resolution plan, the deadline for which ends on Sept. 25.
DHFL, one of the largest housing finance companies in India ran into trouble last year soon after the collapse of IL&FS, a shadow banking behemoth. Troubles at both lenders have sparked an acute liquidity crunch which may worsen.

Instead, it will be only a financial shareholder in subsidiary companies Reliance Home Finance and Reliance Commercial Finance.
""As a part of transformation process, Reliance Capital has decided it will not be in any of the lending businesses,"" Ambani told shareholders at the company's annual general meeting.
""Reliance Commercial Finance and Reliance Home Finance are working closely with all our lenders and other stakeholders to finalise the resolution plans which are expected to be completed in the next few months by December 2019,"" he added.
Ambani said that Reliance Capital will only be a financial shareholder in both these companies to reconverge shareholder value under a new management and shareholding structure and effectively reduce debt of the group by Rs 25,000 crore.
He said the company suffered great collateral damage over the last six months due to a combination of factors, including the crisis in the financial services sector, irrational action by auditors and rating agencies, and now slowdown of the Indian economy.
""Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) suffered collateral damage due to a combination of factors, including reckless selling and rumour mongering over the past six months,"" he said.
Retail shareholders of the company have increased by 10 lakh, he said, adding that it is unfortunate that true value of the business is not recognised amid all the noises.
Ambani said the ADAG had repaid over Rs 35,000 crore in debt over the past 15 months. It is close to repaying another Rs 15,000 crore by March 2020 despite zero funding from any bank, NBFC or financial institution.
Reliance ADAG Group has over Rs 60,000 crore receivables stuck in regulatory and arbitration proceedings for the past five to ten years. ""We are transforming Reliance Capital. It is a young company.""
On Monday, Reliance Capital said it recently made interest and principal repayment of Rs 72.65 crore on a range of instruments, including non-convertible debentures, term loans and inter-corporate deposits.
It said the company remained current on all its repayment obligations. The company completed 21.54 per cent stake sale in Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management to Nippon Life Insurance of Japan for Rs 3,030 crore, it said on Friday.
Following the development, the scrip fell 12.14 per cent to hit a low of Rs 24.60.
Reliance Capital is one of India's largest financial services conglomerates in the country with nearly Rs 90,000 crore of assets, Rs 8,000 crore of net worth and over 18,000 employees.
It has a strong presence across the entire financial services space, including general insurance business, life insurance business, asset reconstruction, securities broking and distribution and commodity exchange businesses. (ANI)

“As a part of transformation process, Reliance Capital has decided it will not be in any of the lending businesses,” Ambani told shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) in Mumbai.
Shares of Reliance Capital fell to Rs 24.20 on BSE, a level last seen on April 24, 1999.
He said that both the company’s lending businesses -- Reliance Commercial Finance and Reliance Home Finance have an asset base of over Rs 25,000 crore.
“Reliance Commercial Finance and Reliance Home Finance are working closely with all our lenders and other stakeholders to finalize the resolution plans which are expected to be completed in the next few months by December 2019,” he added.
NBFC suffered collateral damage due to a combination of factors, including reckless selling and rumour mongering over the past six months,"" he said.
Following the development, the scrip fell 4.11 per cent to hit a low of Rs 26.85.
Ambani said his group had repaid over Rs 35,000 crore in debt over last 15 months. It is close to repaying another Rs 15,000 crore by March 2020, despite nil funding from any bank, NBFC or financial institution.
Reliance ADAG Group has over Rs 60,000 crore receivables stuck in regulatory and arbitration proceedings. “We are transforming Reliance Capital,” Ambani said. “It is a young company.”
On Monday, Reliance Capital said it made interest and principal repayment of Rs 72.65 crore on Friday and Monday on a range of instruments, including non-convertible debentures, term loans and inter-corporate deposits.
It said the company remained current on all its repayment obligations. The company has completed 21.54 per cent stake sale in Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management to Nippon Life Insurance of Japan (Nippon) for Rs 3,030 crore, it said on Friday.

The counsel for DHFL said the company defaulted on the payment of about Rs 200 crore in the month of May.
MUMBAI: Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management has moved the Bombay High Court against stressed non-banking finance company (NBFC) Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) to recover about Rs 478 crore.
The counsel for DHFL said the company defaulted on the payment of about Rs 200 crore in the month of May. The company is seeking its dues after the non-convertible debentures (NCD) that the mutual fund house had subscribed, which were due but the NBFC failed to repay the same.
On Monday, Justice AK Menon, in his oral order, restrained DHFL from paying anyone except salaries and other expenses that happens in normal course of business until Friday. Meanwhile, DHFL will file its reply in the petition filed by the Reliance AMC. The court posted the next date of hearing on Friday.
Reliance AMC, now seeking the court's intervention in the dispute, has total dues of Rs 478 crore. Bondholders have Rs 41,000 crore exposure to DHFL and banks have Rs 27,527 crore. While banks and NBFCs have signed the proposed resolution, some mutual funds have reservations signing it.
State Bank of India has already approached Securities and Exchange Board of India for a one-time exception to the rule on segregation of assets that will allow mutual funds to be part of the resolution plan, ET had reported earlier.
“It looks like mutual funds want to get preferential treatment,” said a source familiar with the development. “Sebi has allowed MFs to be part of ICA but if it is not part of segregated fund they cannot sign ICA but still go ahead with the plan and join other lenders.”
DHFL has proposed that the exposure of lenders be partly converted into equity at an assumed price of Rs 54 per share under a formula that prescribes a the certain percentage for each category, such as banks and debenture holders. Following the conversion, lenders will acquire a 51% stake. The company has secured debt of Rs 74.054 crore and unsecured debt of Rs 9,818 crore
“So far, the company has paid to few unsecured creditors but not us, this is an unfair preference,” argued counsel for Reliance Nippon Life in the court. Senior counsel Iqbal Chagla, along with Zal Andhyarujina and Prateek Mishra of law firm L&L Partners, are representing Reliance AMC in the case.

As per the proposal, in addition to the conversion of debt to equity, liabilities will be restructured into term loans and nonconvertible debentures (NCDs) linked to cash flows from segregated portfolios of the company. DHFL chairman Kapil Wadhawan has however assured lenders and investors that all repayments under the plan will be significantly higher than the liquidation value.
When contacted, Munaf Virjee, founding partner of the law firm, ABH Law, who is advising DHFL and Kapil Wadhawan in the case, refused to divulge any details. An email query to Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management remained unanswered till the time of filing the story.

However, in a strange development, the report has not been submitted to the board of directors. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is aware of the forensic audit report.
In the DHFL matter, the Moneylife report said that the SEBI seems unwilling to enforce the corporate governance rules it had recently made more stringent. SEBI has not asked lenders to present the forensic report to the board of directors for discussion. The report is material disclosure under the listing obligations and disclosure requirements regulations of SEBI.
Deepali Pant Joshi, former executive director of RBI, who is an independent director of DHFL since May this year, says she is unaware of the forensic report and has refused to say if she has raised this with the management, the report noted.
DHFL has been facing allegations of a massive fraud for around 10 months.
At the end of January 2019, a sting by a web portal alleged that the Wadhawans - DFHL Chairman and Managing Director Kapil Wadhawan, his brother and promoter Dheeraj Wadhawan - had siphoned off a massive Rs 31,000 crore to create personal wealth, through a network of shell companies. The KPMG forensic audit appears to have confirmed at least Rs 20,000 crore of that amount, the Moneylife report said.

More than 100,000 fixed deposit (FD) holders, a large number of whom are retirees who invested their life savings, are expected to be impacted. As of July 6, the company had public deposits worth Rs 6,188 crore, down from Rs 10,166.72 crore in March 2018.
Public depositors are at the highest risk since they lack recourse via debt resolution tribunals but would have to turn to civil suits or consumer complaint forums under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
Others who take a hit include commercial banks, which have as much as Rs 38,342 crore exposed in the housing finance company.
Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.
DHFL has faced fraud and fund-diversion allegations since January. This revelation may block its debt resolution plan as the government could now initiate a Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) probe, which would freeze all repayments, the paper noted.
DHFL was working on a debt resolution plan as per the Reserve Bank of India’s stressed asset circular dated June 7. As per the plan, lenders would acquire 51 percent stake in DHFL after converting a portion of the company’s debt to equity. The draft also proposed a staggered 10-year pay-out to public depositors with zero interest.
Further, to arrange for “liability management”, the company stopped new public deposits, renewal of public deposits and premature withdrawal of deposits from May 21, subject to exceptions in case of medical or financial circumstances on providing documentation. But, as per a depositor quoted by the paper, that claims were not honoured even under specified conditions.
DHFL did not respond to Mint’s queries.

The Court : This is an application under section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, as amended by Act 3 of 2015 (in short ""the Act of 1996"").
It is the case of the petitioner that in terms of the agreement dated March 15, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as ""the said agreement"") the respondent no.1 obtained a loan of Rs.21,71,430/- for acquiring the asset mentioned in paragraph 4 to the application. The said asset remains hypothecated in favour of the petitioner. The respondent no.2, as the guarantor, is a party to the said agreement, which contains an arbitration clause.2
According to the petitioner the respondent no.1 failed to make payment of the monthly instalments as per the said agreement and subsequently the repayment schedule of the dues of the respondent no.1 to the petitioner was revised. The respondent has even failed to make payment of the monthly instalment as per the revised payment schedule. It is urged that as on this day Rs.13,68,640.27 remains outstanding from the respondent to the petitioner. The petitioner claims to have terminated the said agreement and in enforcement of its right seeks to take possession of the hypothecated asset through the Receiver.
Considering the facts of the case I find that the petitioner has made out a prima facie case for interim protection.
Accordingly, Mr. Mihir Kundu, Advocate of Bar Association Room No. 2 is appointed as the Receiver to take possession of the hypothecated asset described in paragraph 4 of the application which is presently plying in and around Magurgadia, Keonjhar, Odisha.

The petitioner shall also bear the travelling expenses of the Receiver and provide him with a befitting accommodation at the relevant places. Needless to mention that a competent officer of the petitioner shall all along accompany the Receiver.3
If necessary, the Receiver shall approach the concerned Superintendent of Police, in the state of Odisha for obtaining police assistance to implement this order. If the petitioner deposits the requisite fees with the concerned authorities, the Superintendent of Police shall render necessary police assistance to the Receiver to take actual physical possession of the hypothecated asset from the concerned respondent.
Let, this application appear, under the same heading, on December 9, 2019. The Receiver shall file his report on the next date of hearing.
Urgent certified website copies of this order, if applied for, be supplied to the petitioner upon compliance with all requisite formalities.
The Receiver and all concerned parties, including the Police Authorities shall act on certified website copies of this order.

The share price of YES Bank slipped 3.74% and touched an intraday low of Rs 45 apiece, with 34 lakh and 658 lakh shares trading on BSE and NSE counters today.
Data on the BSE suggested 55% buying against 45% selling on the stock price. Although the share has gained 6% in a week's period, it has declined nearly 30% in a month and 75% year-to-date.
The fall in share price was in line with 'banking sector' that fell 0.41% and broader index Sensex that declined 0.13% in today's trade. Yes Bank stock has reversed trend yesterday and has fallen 4.62% in the last 2 straight sessions of decline. Yes Bank currently trades lower than its 5, 20, 50, 100 and 200-day moving averages.
The agency kept Basel III Tier 2 bonds to IND A, Additional Basel III Tier 1 bonds to BBB+ and Infrastructure bonds to A, placing all the instruments under 'downgraded' rating option and under RWN.
The agency said it has simultaneously placed the ratings on Rating Watch Negative (RWN), indicating that either the rating will be affirmed or downgraded from the earlier rating that was 'Negative' outlook.
The agency added that RWN reflects the dependency of the rating level on the timing and quantum of equity raised by the bank and will be resolved depending on the infusion of the same. Ind-Ra expects to receive clarity on this issue by next month.
Ind-Ra in its report said, ""The downgrade reflects the inadequate progress as per Ind-Ra's expectations with respect to the quantum and pace of equity infusions, which is critical for providing sufficient cushion for the credit cost impact of the stressed asset pool.""
""Although the liquidity position of the bank seemed adequate at end-September 2019, Ind-Ra believes that, in the absence of improvements on the capital side, the ability of the bank to manage its asset and liability maturities might be tested further,"" it added.
Besides the delays in capital raising, Ind-Ra pointed out concurrent credit migration in certain exposures as the key driver in the rating downgrade. It said that some of the bank's corporate exposure spread over multiple sectors resulting in rapid credit migration over the last few quarters.",pass,sample

Among the expected steps doing the rounds in the markets is a merger with a deep-pocketed public sector bank as Yes Bank, unlike other struggling private companies, is systemically important.
Sources said that one of the stronger PSU banks, which is not part of the ongoing merger exercise, may be asked to take over the Yes Bank. The exercise would not be unprecedented as earlier (in 2003) the Oriental Bank of Commerce was asked to take over scam-ridden Global Trust Bank to rescue thousands of depositors having exposure in the bank.
""If a private sector solution is unsuccessful, and a regulatory-led resolution is implemented, Moody's expects that the Indian authorities will strive to maintain systemic stability and avoid losses to depositors and senior creditors,"" Moody's said.
Earlier this month, Yes Bank rejected Erwin Singh Braich's $1.2 billion investment offer and said it will raise Rs 10,000 crore by issuing securities. The bank also said it will take up Citax Holdings, and Citax Investment Group's investment offers in the next board meeting.
Uncertainty on the banks future have also found roots owing to the corporate governance issues. Recently, Independent Director and Audit Committee Chairman Uttam Prakash Agarwal resigned, alleging that CEO and MD Ravneet Gill was misleading the bank's board and shareholders.
Besides, the bank's financials have also come under heavy scrutiny. Rating agency ICRA noted that Yes Bank's solvency profile remains weak with net NPA/CET of 36 percent as on September 30, 2019. A number of rating firms have red flagged the bank's exposure to stressed projects.
Owing to uncertain news flow, Yes Bank, once the traders favorite, has proved to be one of the biggest wealth destroyers. Its stock price on Friday closed at Rs 39.25 a share from a high of Rs 285.90 in April 4, 2019.
Citing continued uncertainty with regards to Yes Bank's capital raising plan, Moody's Investors Service placed Yes Bank's long-term foreign currency issuer rating of B2 under review.
The agency noted that standalone viability of Yes Bank is getting increasingly challenged by its slowness in raising new capital.
Moody's said that because the viability of the bank absent a large capital injection is in question, Moody's has downgraded the bank's standalone credit profile or its BCA to caa2 from b3.

From March 27, shares in the private sector lender will exit the benchmark index and will be replaced by Shree Cement, a Kolkata-based manufacturer of cement. The reshuffle comes in the backdrop of a periodic review by the National Stock Exchange (NSE), which will also replace few other stocks in its indices from the close of market hours on March 26, according to a statement by the bourse.
Currently, Yes Bank shares are available to investors at the lowest price among the 50 Nifty components, which include Eicher Motors, Nestle India, Bajaj Finance and Maruti Suzuki. It is the only Nifty stock available at a two-digit price for past few months.
Shree Cement will be shifted from the NSE's Nifty Next 50 basket of shares to the Nifty 50 index.
Last week, the troubled private sector bank delayed the release of its financial results for the October-December period, and said it is in talks with potential investors for a cash infusion.
Yes Bank said it had received non-binding expressions of interest from JC Flowers, Tilden Park Capital Management, OHA (UK) (part of Oak Hill Advisors) and Silver Point Capital for a cash infusion.
Yes Bank shares are down 25.35 per cent so far this year (as of Tuesday's closing price), following a 74.17 per cent fall in 2019.
Many groups have downgraded the Yes Bank stock. Credit ratings agency Moody's last month put Yes Bank under review stating that the lender's ""standalone viability"" is ""getting increasingly challenged by its slowness in raising new capital"", after lowering them the previous month.
In January, Yes Bank said it had rejected a $1.2 billion investment offer from Canadian investor Erwin Singh Braich and Hong Kong-based SPGP Holdings - an offer about which many analysts expressed doubt.
Besides Shree Cement, the NSE will exclude Ashok Leyland, Indiabulls Housing Finance, L&T Financial Holdings and Vodafone Idea from the Nifty Next 50 index to accommodate Adani Transmission, IDBI Bank, Info Edge, Larsen & Toubro Infotech and Torrent Pharmaceuticals from the same day.
The NSE makes changes in the components of its indices, so as to capture the overall behaviour of equity markets, from time to time.
Just like other stock exchanges, the NSE creates its indices by selecting groups of stocks that are representative of the whole market or a particular sector or segment of the market.
Its Nifty 50 benchmark index contains 50 components - or stocks - accounting for 13 sectors of the economy, including banking, automobiles, consumer goods, metals and pharmaceuticals.

Crisil has downgraded its rating on long-term debt instruments, bank facilities and fixed deposit programme of PNB Housing Finance Ltd worth Rs 4,000 crore to AA/FAA plus from AA plus/FAAA.
It has also revised the outlook on long-term ratings to stable from negative. The rating on the commercial paper issue and short-term non-convertible debentures have been reaffirmed at A1 plus.
Consequent to redemption, Crisil has also withdrawn its rating on non-convertible debentures of Rs 155 crore in line with its withdrawal policy. The agency received independent confirmation that these instruments are fully redeemed.
Earlier in July 2019, Crisil had revised the rating outlook to negative due to concerns over leverage metrics, moderation in capital adequacy ratios and increased vulnerability of asset quality in the wholesale loan portfolio.
""The current downgrade in long-term rating is driven by lower than expected equity raise which will result in the correction in gearing metrics being lower than earlier envisaged,"" said Crisil.
Also Read
""The rating action also factors in weakening of asset quality metrics due to slippages from some large developer accounts in the wholesale loan portfolio,"" it added.
However, Crisil also noted that PNB Housing's fundraising ability has remained intact over the last six to nine months and it is continuing to maintain high on-balance liquidity.
Further, Crisil noted that the management now intends to recalibrate their growth strategy keeping in mind the capital availability and also increase the share of retail book due to challenges in the wholesale book.
This will ensure that post equity raise, the leverage metrics and capital adequacy levels remain under control. Consequently, the outlook has been revised to stable.

“We wish to inform that the mutual due diligence is substantially complete, and the parties are in discussions on the next steps. The Bank will continue to share any further information as and when they materialize,” the bank said in a communication to exchanges.
Earlier, the bank had signed a preliminary, non-binding letter of intent (LOI) with Clix Capital Services Private Limited and Clix Finance India Private Limited as on June 15, 2020, in relation to the proposed amalgamation of Clix Group with the bank.
Under the non-binding LOI, the proposed amalgamation is subject to completion of mutual due-diligence, regulatory and other customary approvals. As per the mutual understanding between parties, the exclusivity period was extended till September 15 due to the prevailing pandemic situation.
With NPAs high and CAR inadequate, the RBI had put the bank under watch in September last year. The bank was pinning its hopes on Indiabulls deal last year for a possible merger but the RBI had rejected the merger in October last year without citing a reason.
In October last year, rating agency CARE had downgraded Lakshmi Vilas Bank’s bond programme of Rs 318 crore to BB+ with negative outlook from BBB-. The bank was put under prompt corrective action (PCA) by the RBI after high level of bad loans, insufficient capital adequacy ratio, negative return on assets (RoA) for two consecutive years and high leverage. The RBI took this decision after assessing the deterioration in FY19 numbers.
Clix Capital is into financial services offering various types of loans and is headed by Pramod Bhasin who acquired the business in 2016 from GE Capital. Private equity firm AION Capital Partners is a significant shareholder in the company.
Early this month, Lakshmi Vilas said it plans to raise up to Rs 1,500 crore to fund business growth and increase foreign shareholding to up to 74 percent.

On Sunday, the RBI approved a committee consisting of three independent directors to manage the day-to-day affairs of LVB. The committee, comprising chairperson Meeta Makhan, Shakti Sinha and Satish Kumar Kalra, has been vested with the discretionary powers of the MD and CEO in the interim.
“It is not a setback to the merger talks,” two top bank officials said, requesting anonymity.
“In fact, it is a blessing to the bank as the current situation has been noticed by the Reserve Bank, which has now appointed a Committee of Directors to manage the bank,” they said.
“The bank has kept the RBI notified about the merger talks at every stage. Shareholders have opposed the continuation of old directors and appointment of certain new directors,” they added.
“Shareholders don’t have anything against the merger or raising of funds,” the two officials said.
As on date, the bank has four independent directors and two RBI nominees.
In a statement Mr. Sinha said the interests of deposit holders, bond holders, account holders and creditors are protected as the bank had a Liquidity Coverage Ratio of about 262% on September 27, against a minimum 100% required by the RBI.

All India Bank Employees’ Association general secretary C.H. Venkatachalam mooted the idea of merging Lakshmi Vilas Bank with any south-based public sector bank, “to ensure that public depositors’ money is secured.”

This will be the first tranche of the ₹10,000 crore worth NCD issuance that PFC plans to make this quarter and for which a draft shelf prospectus has already been filed with regulatory authorities, sources close to the developments said.
The fund mobilised is likely to be used for lending to the power sector besides fulfilling some of the obligations cast on PFC under the recently announced Atmanirbhar stimulus package, it is learnt.
Indications are that a separate prospectus for the first tranche will be filed with the Registrar of Companies next Monday. Each NCD will have a face value of ₹1,000 and the coupons offered on them are going to be higher (likely to go up to 7.5 per cent) than the fixed deposit rates offered by banks. The tenor of the bonds could be varying, up to 10 years.
Thanks to the huge monetary stimulus unleashed by the RBI and other central banks around the world, there is gush of liquidity in the Indian financial system, bringing down the deposit rates offered by banks. For instance, a three-year term deposit of SBI offers 5.3 per cent annual interest, which is the lowest since September 2004.
Taxable instrument
Unlike in the past, when PFC offered tax-free bonds to individual investors, the latest NCD issue will be taxable, sources said. This may temper down the net yield that investors could look for in the NCDs, which have been rated 'AAA'.
Based on the response to the first tranche, the next could be rolled out within a fortnight, sources said. In all, PFC wants to complete the mop-up in three tranches and there is also a greenshoe option available to the state-owned infrastructure lender.

""We look forward for the market to accept the current issue too in line with our previous NCD issues as there are limited comparable investment avenues available,"" said George Alexander Muthoot, Managing Director, Muthoot Finance.
The bonds are proposed to be issued under this issue have been rated CRISIL AA/Positive by CRISIL and [ICRA] AA (Stable) by ICRA, the company said.

The Bombay High Court on Tuesday refused to grant bail to Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor's wife and two daughters in a corruption and cheating case involving private sector lender Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL).
A single bench of Justice Bharati Dangre rejected the bail applications filed by Kapoor's wife Bindu and daughters Roshini and Radha.
The three had approached the HC last week, challenging a special CBI court order of September 18 which refused them bail while noting that they had, prima facie, caused a loss of Rs 4,000 crore to the Yes Bank through illegal acts.
The lower court had remanded them in 14-day judicial custody and said they did not deserve any sympathy for being women.
The three are currently lodged at the Byculla women's prison in Mumbai.
In their bail pleas filed in the HC, they had said the special CBI court gravely erred in observing that the accusations against them prima facie show complicity in having co-fraudulently and dishonestly received loans as quid pro quo for favour shown by the Yes Bank to DHFL.
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had opposed their pleas and said there was nothing wrong with the special court's order and that it was merely securing the presence of the accused for the purpose of trial.
The CBI's case is that Rana Kapoor, who is currently in jail in connection with a related case being probed by the Enforcement Directorate, had entered into a criminal conspiracy with DHFL's Kapil Wadhawan.
The CBI stated that between April and June 2018, Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of DHFL. In return, DHFL allegedly paid a kickback of Rs 900 crore to Kapoor in the form of loans to one DoIT Urban Ventures, a firm controlled by Kapoor's wife and daughters.

``We have decided to be a diversified, digital retail player,’’ said Anand Piramal, Executive Director, Piramal Group who leads the financial services business. ``We aim to make the wholesale one-third of the book,’’ he said, adding that even the builder loans could turn profitable due to recovery in the construction business.
Investors are bidding up Piramal Enterprises on hopes that there would be two separate companies focusing on those businesses, narrowing the discount of diversified business.
Piramal Enterprises, which is listed on the bourses, has two lines of business – Piramal Capital & Housing Finance and Piramal Pharma Ltd, which is an 80% owned subsidiary and the remaining owned by buyout firm Carlyle Group.
The merger offers Piramal's financial services company 287 branches. At present, it has merely 14 branches and 23,286 customers. The merger would also help in improving the asset liability portfolio and boost the share of retail loans.
The group has on Wednesday paid Rs 34,250 crore to creditors in the first ever resolution in the financial services space using the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the biggest one this fiscal. The group also has interest in real estate.
""It's a defining milestone,"" group chairman Ajay Piramal said. ""This gives us the opportunity to address the financing needs of the under-served `Bharat' market in the affordable (housing) segment.""
The total size of the resolution is Rs 38060 crore, which is about 46% of the total dues to the creditors. Out of this, Rs 34250 crore is being paid by the group and the balance Rs 3810 crore is cash balance lying with DHFL.
The payment by the group includes an upfront cash component of Rs 14,700 crore and issuance of 10-year non-convertible debentures worth Rs 19,550 crore carrying a coupon of 6.75% per annum.
Depositors of DHFL got around 23% of their money back. In absolute terms, they received a total of Rs 1250 crore out of Rs 5400 crore of deposits as per the resolution plan approved by the regulators.
The merged entity is likely to have a loan portfolio of around Rs 65,000 crore. The final calculations are yet to be completed, the group chairman said.
""We will use technology to become competitive,"" Piramal said. Majority of DHFL's borrowers are non-salaried in the tier 2 and tier 3 cities. There will also be a 130 basis points reduction in average borrowing costs.
Piramal Capital & Housing raised Rs 18,000 crore of equity in the last two years by selling its stake in companies and through issuing fresh shares.

CreditAccess Grameen fell 3.41% to Rs 598.90 after the company reported 7.9% fall in standalone net profit to Rs 71.99 crore despite 8.3% rise in total income to Rs 510.33 crore in Q2 FY22 over Q2 FY21.
The microfinance institution recorded an operating profit of Rs 194.71 crore in the second quarter, up 10.5% YoY.
Provisions and write-offs increased by 39.5% to Rs 91.12 crore in Q2 FY22 from Rs 65.32 crore in Q2 FY21.
Profit before tax in Q2 FY22 stood at Rs 97.11 crore, down by 7.3% from Rs 104.80 crore in Q2 FY21.
Gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratio was 7.18% in Q2 FY22 as against 1.64% in Q2 FY22 and 8.12% in Q1 FY22.

Disbursements were Rs 3,412 crore in Q2 FY22 as against Rs 1,420 crore in Q2 FY21 and Rs 907 crore in Q1 FY22.
Gross Loan Portfolio (GLP) increased by 21.5% to Rs 11,184 crore in Q2 FY22 from Rs 9,207 crore in Q2 FY21. GLP has risen by 5.3% from Rs 10,625 crore in Q1 FY22.
CreditAccess Grameen restructured loans aggregating Rs 99.1 crore in Q2 FY22 as against Rs 6.9 crore in Q1 FY22. Overall, the MFI has restructured loans aggregating Rs 183.1 crore (including restructuring of loans worth Rs 77.1 crore done in FY21). Total provisioning on restructured loans, which account for 1.5% of GLP as on September-end 2021, was 28.8%.
CreditAccess Grameen's consolidated net profit, which includes the results of three subsidiaries viz. Madura Micro Finance (MMFL), Madura Micro Education and CreditAccess India Foundation, declined 19.7% to Rs 63.57 crore on a 7.2% rise in total income to Rs 618.58 crore in Q2 FY22 over Q2 FY21.
Udaya Kumar Hebbar, MD and CEO of CreditAccess Grameen, said, The signs of significant rebound in the rural economy during Q2 FY22 augurs well for our company as we were able to disburse Rs 3,890 crore and contribute to the rural capital creation story across the country. Our consolidated portfolio grew by 19.2% YoY to Rs 13,333 crore in Q2 FY22.
Our collection efficiency consistently improved to 93.3% at CA Grameen and 87% at MMFL in Sep-21. We opened 121 branches in Q2 FY22, primarily in the newer markets like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand and Rajasthan.
As a part of completion of the process integration with MMFL, we have aligned MMFL's provisioning policy with CA Grameen, recognising GNPA at 60+ dpd compared to 90+ dpd. While this led to higher provisioning during the second quarter, we considered this at an appropriate time given that all the process, policies and operating model have been integrated under one umbrella.
We maintained strong business momentum in Oct-21, disbursing Rs 1,372 crore resulting in consolidated portfolio growth of 20.2% YoY to Rs 13,647 crore. Collection efficiency further improved in Oct-21 to 94.3% for CA Grameen and 87% for MMFL. We opened another 21 branches in Oct-21, taking the total branch network to 1,566. Overall, we added near 2 lakh new borrowers during Jul-21 to Oct-21.
Assuming that there are no further severe business disruptions on account of Covid, we look forward to achieving loan portfolio growth of 17%-19% with a credit cost of 4.7%-4.9% resulting in an ROA of 1.8%-2.0% for the FY22.
CreditAccess Grameen is a microfinance institution focused on providing micro-loans to women customers predominantly in rural areas across India. The company, on consolidated basis, is now operating in 303 districts in the 14 states in India through 1,566 branches.

Our collections were not hit to the extent of others post-Covid. Yes, our Stage 3 bad loans increased, but it was a temporary phenomenon. Our Stage 3 bad loans went up to around 9.5% last year, which came back to 7.3%, and this time it again went up to around 8.5% in the first quarter and came down to 8.2% in the second quarter. We have a target of bringing it down to below 7% by the end of the fiscal. Trucking is considered to be cyclical and when you are in an upcycle you get good value and when you are in a downcycle then people look at other companies. When you have multiple products, you have multiple engines to fire on and it becomes easier to keep generating revenue from products, which helps in counter-cyclicality. Lenders and rating agencies also prefer that companies have a diversified rather than a single portfolio.
How will it help in terms of funding?
A bigger treasury will help us negotiate better and price better. A rating upgrade should happen to the extent of at least the City Union portfolio because of the merger. The City Union portfolio was AA and their Stage 3 loans were a little less than transport finance. They slowed down significantly in the last two years as the risk was higher and we were able to grow during that time. We will have combined capital adequacy of about 24% so we will not require any capital at least in the short term.
What is the projected growth in the next three years?

Non-banking finance company IIFL Finance on Tuesday said it has bought back USD 50 million worth of overseas bonds with funds raised through a loan from a global bank
Non-banking finance company IIFL Finance on Tuesday said it has bought back USD 50 million worth of overseas bonds with funds raised through a loan from a global bank.
The buyback will reduce the company's cost of funds by around 225 basis points.
IIFL Finance had raised USD 400 million through its maiden overseas bonds in February 2020 at an issue price of USD 998.75 per bond to fund its business growth, a release said.
The company, which had in the last two years bought back bonds worth USD 26.3 million in various tranches, launched a tender offer on March 21, 2022 to further buy back up to USD 50 million worth of bonds.
The minimum bid price for bondholders under the tender offer was USD 970 per bond.

The face value of one bond is USD 1,000.
However, most bids received were closer to the par value, and accordingly the company bought back the entire tender amount of USD 50 million at par.
""The abundant liquidity and the price at which we bought back reflect the confidence that bondholders have in us. Also, this reduces our cost of funds by approximately 225 basis points for the arrangement,"" IIFL Finance CFO Rajesh Rajak said.
The buyback was done under a modified Dutch auction process which is a reverse book building mechanism.
All bids (i.e, at par or lower) were received at a uniform price. After this buyback, USD 323.7 million of bonds remain outstanding, the release said.
As on December 2021, IIFL Finance's free cash, equivalent and undrawn lines stood at Rs 9,145 crore, adequate to meet not only its all the near-term liabilities but also to fund the future growth momentum.
Its loan assets under management was Rs 46,780 crore at the end of December 2021, while the capital adequacy ratio stood at 25.4 per cent and provision coverage ratio was at 133 per cent.
As on December 2021, about 94 per cent of its loan book comprised of retail loans.

- Premises of ABIL and Bhosale were also searched during the operation.
- The CBI has now arrested Bhosale in a 2020 case against Kapoor and Wadhawan among others for alleged corruption.

New Delhi: The CBI on Thursday arrested Avinash Bhosale, chairman of Pune-based real estate group ABIL group, in an alleged corruption case involving Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor and Kapil Vadhawan of DHFL, officials said. The CBI suspects that illicit funds were routed through several real estate companies based in Maharashtra, they said. The agency had carried out searches at the premises of noted builders of the state on April 30 to further probe on this aspect of the case, they said.
Premises of ABIL and Bhosale were also searched during the operation.
The CBI has now arrested Bhosale in a 2020 case against Kapoor and Wadhawan among others for alleged corruption.
The CBI had recently arrested Sanjay Chhabria of Radius Developers in the case.
The agency has alleged that Kapoor entered into a criminal conspiracy with Wadhawan for extending financial assistance to DHFL through Yes Bank in return for substantial undue benefits to himself and his family members through companies held by them, they said.
According to the CBI FIR, the scam started taking shape between April and June 2018, when Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short term debentures of scam-hit DHFL.
In return, Wadhawan allegedly ""paid kickback of Rs 600 crore"" to Kapoor and family members in the form of loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd, they said.
DoIT Urban Ventures is held by daughters of Kapoor -- Roshini, Radha and Rakhee -- who are 100 per cent share holders of the company through Mogran Credits Pvt Ltd, it alleged.
The loan of Rs 600 crore was sanctioned by DHFL to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd on the basis of mortgage of sub-standard properties having very meagre value and by considering its future conversation from agricultural land to residential land, the agency has alleged.
It was further found that DHFL had not redeemed the amount of Rs 3,700 crore invested by Yes Bank in its debentures till date, it said.
In addition to the above, Yes Bank also sanctioned a loan of Rs 750 crore to RKW Developers Pvt Ltd whose director is Dheeraj Wadhawan and is a DHFL group company for their Bandra reclamation project which was transferred by it to DHFL without any investment in the project for which it was sanctioned, they said.
""Rana Kapoor obtained undue pecuniary advantage from DHFL in the matter of investment in the debentures of DHFL by Yes Bank, through the companies held by his wife and daughters,"" the FIR alleged.

Shares of YES Bank traded 4.42 per cent lower at Rs 14.06 in the morning trade at around 11.15 am (IST) on Monday. On the other hand, the benchmark BSE Sensex was down 481 points, or 0.86 per cent at 55,590
YES Bank on Saturday reported a 50.17 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit at Rs 310.63 crore against Rs 206.84 crore in the same quarter last year.
Brokerage Nirmal Bang Securities maintained a ‘Sell’ rating on YES Bank with a target price of Rs 13.40. “Despite the overall better-than-expected results and an improving overall picture at the bank, we find medium-term ROA targets unattractive given the investable opportunities available with larger banks,” the brokerage said.
On the other hand, ICICI Securities maintained a ‘Hold’ rating on YES Bank with a target price of Rs 14. “We do see a turnaround in relevant operating metrics and improved confidence in the stability of the franchise. Nonetheless, we remain cognizant of risks arising from delay in resolution of the stress pool, net labelled exposure of 5 per cent, modest RoE profile during transition and supply overhang post the expiry of lock-in shares,” ICICI Securities said.
Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a 26 per cent rise in its net profit to Rs 2,071.15 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal year aided by a fall in bad loans. Shares of the lender traded 1.76 per cent down at Rs 1,794.25 in the morning trade.
Brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services retained a ‘Neutral’ view on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target price of Rs 2,000. On the other hand, JM Financial has a ‘Buy’ rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target price of Rs 2,000.
“We believe success on deposit momentum with continued strong risk-adjusted margins will drive Kotak’s outperformance incrementally and sustain its premium valuations,” JM Financial said in a report.
The country’s second biggest private sector lender ICICI Bank on Saturday also posted a 50 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in profit after tax at Rs 6,905 crore as against Rs 4,616 crore in the same quarter last year. JM Financial also retained a ‘Buy’ call on ICICI Bank with a target price of Rs 1,000. Shares of the lender traded 0.21 per cent down at Rs 798.30 at around 11.25 am (IST).
“ICICI bank reported another strong quarter with robust growth performance, steady operational performance and improving asset quality. We see ICICI Bank delivering strong compounding returns with valuations set to re-rate higher. ICICI Bank continues to be our top pick in the sector,” JM Financial said.

Without naming the two entities, Kumar said both of them were from the set of 13 bidders that had participated in the initial bidding process to acquire the bank’s stressed assets.
The two entities that have shown interest in the assets are reported to be ARCION Asset Reconstruction Company, and Asset Reconstruction Company of India Ltd (ARCIL). ARCION ARC is in the process of being acquired by Cerberus Capital Management — one of the initial bidders for the assets.
Swiss auction
As per the Swiss Challenge auction, if either of the two entities bids higher than JC Flowers ARC, the latter will have the option to match the bid. If any other ARC wins the Swiss challenge, the entire portfolio will go to that entity. This might also disrupt the lender’s plan of investing in an ARC as the winning entity will decide if they want the lender as a partner.
If JC Flowers is selected as the ARC post the Swiss Challenge, YES Bank plans to invest up to ₹350 crore for a 20 per cent stake in the asset reconstruction joint venture. Kumar had then said the entire process for completion of the Swiss Challenge and transfer of the stressed assets will take about 60-75 days.
On Saturday, while discussing the bank’s Q1FY23 results, Kumar said the bank has entered into a binding term sheet with JC Flowers ARC which has submitted a ₹11,183-crore bid for the stressed assets. This was accepted as the base bid for the Swiss Challenge process.
The interested entities will now begin the due diligence process by “around the first week of August” following which they will submit the financial bids, he said today.
“By the end of August, we would be in a position to declare the final winner,” Kumar added.
The proposed asset sale will help clean-up the private lender’s asset quality, bringing down its gross NPA ratio to below 2 per cent from 13.4 per cent as of June, YES Bank had guided earlier.

This will require tougher underwriting, and the average ticket size of loans is expected to come down to around ₹20 lakh, he said at an event to launch a campaign focussed on lending to underserved and unbanked customers.
“Piramal Finance provides loans to customers by not only validating the formal credit history and papers/documents but also, evaluating customers on the basis of their intent and integrity - thereby highlighting the differentiated lending experience,” the company said in a release.

The company plans to focus on budget-conscious customers, as well as medium and small businesses in tier-2 and tier-3 towns, by looking past documentation as the only method to assess creditworthiness, it said.
A wholly-owned subsidiary of Piramal Enterprises, Piramal Finance has 343 branches in 293 cities and towns, and the company is rapidly expanding its footprint in tier-II and tier-III cities, especially in North and South India, with the aim of expanding to 1,000 locations through 500 to 600 branches over the next five years.
Following the merger of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation in September 2021, the retail loan book has grown to ₹24,872 crore. The lender now has 22 lakh customers and offers 11 retail products, including the launch of branch-led personal loans to salaried individuals in tier 2 and 3 towns. It also has 22 live partnerships with fintechs, OEMs, and aggregators under the digital embedded finance business.

Baring PE Asia had previously been among the major contenders to acquire ICICI Home Finance, a deal that didn’t materialise.
While some people say BPEA could be eyeing a controlling stake in the company, a senior Shriram Housing Finance executive denied any buyout rumour. He said discussions are on with prospective investors for fund raising and the Shriram Group remained committed to the housing finance business.
Shriram Finance holds 85% of the housing finance subsidiary while the rest is with Valiant Mauritius (P) Ltd. The group will take a final call on the quantum of the stake sale after firm offers come in, said the people cited above.
A BPEA EQT spokesperson declined to comment.
“By virtue of the strong parentage, SHFL also stands to benefit from the established track record of the group in lending to the self-employed segment in tier-II and smaller towns, which is the customer profile for SHFL as well,” said a recent Care Rating report. “The ratings take note of the significant growth in AUM over the last 3.5 years.”
About 35-40% of Shriram Housing’s business comes from the southern states — Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It also has a presence in Gujarat. With a network of 94 branches, it has an average loan size of Rs 16.6 lakh.
Last year, European buyout fund EQT acquired Baring Private Equity Asia for $7.5 billion. It closed its eighth private equity fund — the Baring Asia Private Equity Fund VIII — with total capital commitments of $11.2 billion. BPEA also owns a 9.98% stake in RBL Bank through its vehicle Maple II BV.
BPEA EQT has a strong presence in India through buyouts such as Hinduja Global Solutions Limited (HGS) as well as CitiusTech, AGS Healthcare and Coforge Ltd (formerly NIIT Technologies).
In the past few months, the housing finance sector has become active in terms of M&A deals. Poonawalla Fincorp sold its subsidiary Poonawalla Housing Finance to Perseus SG Pte Ltd, an entity affiliated with TPG Global LLC, for Rs 3,900 crore, while Centrum Housing Finance entered into a binding business transfer agreement with the National Trust Housing Finance (Natrust) to acquire its housing finance business, branches and employees.",pass,sample

While Cholamandalam forayed into financing EVs in 2021, it is unlikely to go on an aggressive mode in this business over the near term amid the growing EV adoption in two- and three-wheeler segments.
“Currently we are cautious about lending to EVs because there are no adequate data on the resale value of these products, we need to work on some notional value based on assumptions. So, at this stage, we are not adopting an aggressive approach in lending to EVs as we need to acquire more experience in this space,” D Arulselvan, President & CFO, Cholamandalam Investments & Finance Company told businessline.
Risk profile
While financing is seen as an important factor in accelerating EV adoption in the country, banks and NBFCs have taken a cautious approach to financing EVs. The uncertainty of resale value, risk of technological obsolescence, and lack of historical data make it difficult for financing institutions to assess the risk profile for EV lending.
Rohan Kumar Gupta, Vice President & Sector Head-Corporate Ratings, Icra Ltd said, “While the financial institutions are looking at increasing their exposure to the EV segment, a cautionary stance prevails currently given the inherent risks like the limited track record of product performance, recall management of OEMs, lack of an established second-hand market, etc. Estimating the resale value of EVs remains a challenge as this is subject to battery performance.”
The Murugappa Group NBFC Cholamandalam is now lending to a few brands, including Mahindra & Mahindra and Piaggio, in electric three-wheeler space. It is now providing financing support to commercial electric three-wheelers .In the electric two-wheeler space, it has tied up two brands which include Hero Electric.
“On average, we are currently doing average disbursements of about ₹10 crore a month in the EV space,” said Arulselvan.
Loan disbursements
In its ESG information, the company has said that it will increase EV loan disbursements by 5 per cent year-on-year between 2023 and 2025. Its EV loan disbursements were at ₹11.97 crore in FY22 and in FY23 (during April-December), it stood at about ₹52 crore.
In the vehicle loan segment, Cholamandalam has a well-diversified portfolio spread across more than 1,130 branches across India. In FY23, the vehicle segment’s disbursements stood at ₹39,699 crore, which was about 60 per cent of the total disbursements.
Innovation in financing structures with better use of technology, creation of more climate funds, priority sector lending, co-lending between traditional and new-age financiers, etc are some of the expectations of the key stakeholders in the EV industry.
“We expect that the lending environment to gradually improve with a better EV penetration and track record of incumbents,” said Gupta.
Tube Investments’ EV dive
Meanwhile, its group company Tube Investments will shortly be introducing its Montra electric autorickshaw, starting in southern States. Cholamandalam may provide lending support for its buyers.

Debt market sources said the funds are likely to be raised through non-convertible bonds (NCDs) in one or more tranches
Listen to This Article
Tata Capital Financial Services Ltd (TCFSL) plans to raise up to Rs 7,000 crore via bonds to support growth even as efforts for its merger, along with that of Tata Cleantech Capital, with parent Tata Capital Ltd (TCL) are underway in the current financial year.
TCFSL, which is into retail, SME, and corporate funding posted 32.03 per cent year-on-year growth in assets to Rs 78,499 crore at end of March 2023. Its capital adequacy ratio was 17.3 per cent with tier-1 level of 13 per cent. Its parent TCL had infused funds of Rs 1,150 crore in the form of equity shares into TCFSL during the second half of the 2023 fiscal year.
Debt market sources said funds were likely to be raised through non-convertible bonds in one or more tranches. Separately, the company has also lined up reissuance of bonds having three-year maturity for next week. The base issue is Rs 200 crore with a green shoe option of Rs 800 crore.
CRISIL Ratings has assigned its “AAA/Stable” rating for proposed NCDs of Rs 7,000 crore. The assessment for rating is done on consolidated basis with Tata Capital at parent and subsidiaries TCFSL, Tata Capital Housing Finance, Tata Cleantech Capital Limited, Tata Securities and Tata Capital, Singapore.
CRISIL said the merger is a part of the Tata group’s broader plans to meet the revised regulatory framework for TCFSL, which has been identified as an upper-layer NBFC, pursuant to the RBI’s scale-based regulations. The merger would further enable simplified organisational structure and improve operational and management efficiencies, it added.

- The Shriram Group has appointed investment bankers from Barclays Bank, JM Financial and Avendus Capital to shortlist buyers
The Shriram Group is in talks with US-based fund management giants Warburg Pincus Llc and Bain Capital LP to sell its housing arm Shriram Housing Finance Ltd for around ₹5,000 crore, two people directly familiar with the development said.
Shriram Housing Finance is a midsize housing finance company with assets of over ₹10,000 crore. The sale is part of the Chennai-headquartered conglomerate’s plan to redesign its growth strategy.
A Shriram Group spokesperson declined to comment.
Over the past few weeks, the bankers appointed by the group’s listed flagship Shriram Finance Ltd, which holds 85% in Shriram Housing Finance as the promoter, opened discussions with Bain Capital and Warburg Pincus, the people cited above said. If the negotiations conclude, a deal could be closed before the June quarter, they added.
“(We) Have received a phenomenal interest from several suitors. There are buyers with bids of up to ₹5,000-5,500 crore and offers are still coming. It’s a neat business and bidders are credible. So, evaluation before a sale may not take much time,"" the first of the two people cited above said.
The Shriram Group has appointed investment bankers from Barclays Bank Plc, JM Financial Ltd and Avendus Capital Pvt. Ltd to shortlist buyers, the two people added.
Spokespeople from JM Financial and Barclays declined to comment while queries sent to Bain, Warburg Pincus and Avendus remained unanswered.
“The demand for affordable housing finance firms is intact in India, especially given the potential in tier-II cities and locations beyond them. Also, the company’s (Shriram Housing) financials and growth rate are stronger than others in the comparable segment. The interest rate cycle is currently favourable and retail investors may benefit from that. The company has a wide presence. The buyer can leverage on these factors,"" said the second person.
The group will use the proceeds from a successful sale to expand new businesses in the financial services space and strengthen its balance sheet.
The Shriram Group, which is primarily in financial services, recently launched its own asset reconstruction company and a super app called Shriram One that provides a one-stop solution to customers for financial planning, investments, loans, insurance, UPI money transfers, mobile and DTH recharges, and other bill payments.
According to the two persons, apart from its core lending business done directly through its main non-banking financial company (NBFC) Shriram Finance, the group intends to focus on the new ventures and beef up the cash component in its books, which is one of the reasons why it is looking to sell off the housing finance arm that has hitherto focused on the tough business of affordable housing.
Shriram Housing’s loan portfolio has grown at a steep 44% compound annual growth rate over the last four years, and about three-fourths of its business comes from India’s western and southern states with an average loan size of ₹16.6 lakh.
However, the business of affordable housing has become somewhat challenging over the past year, which is another reason why the group is now planning to exit this business and redesign its growth strategy by increasing focus on Shriram Finance’s core lending business and the two insurance ventures.
“A major challenge for the housing finance company has been its concentration in the southern and western states and more than two-thirds of the housing loan business coming from unbanked, self-employed homebuyers,"" said the second person.
Ravi Subramanian, managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO), Shriram Housing Finance, on 2 January, stated in a Mint report, “Within the affordable housing segment, we are witnessing different trends in urban vs semi-urban segments. On the urban side, high land costs and rising material costs make the affordable housing segment unattractive for realtors. Consequently, the share of affordable homes in the overall residential realty market is shrinking rapidly.""
He said rate hikes totalling 2.50 percentage points by the Reserve Bank of India in a short period of less than a year have had some impact on the consumer’s psyche and the market did see some degree of postponement in purchases when the cycle was underway.
According to property consultant Anarock, real estate developers are now launching fewer affordable housing units and more mid and luxury-segment projects. The share of affordable homes in the total new supply during Q2FY24 fell to 18% in seven major cities, from 42% in 2018. In the total launches, too, the share of affordable homes has been falling steadily since 2018. The urban labour market has not witnessed a surge post-pandemic and that dealt another major blow to the affordable housing segment.",pass,sample

The systemically important non-deposit-taking NBFC has been prohibited by the central bank from offering any kind of financing against shares and debentures, including the approval and disbursement of loans against share initial public offerings (IPOs) and debenture subscriptions. This is a significant regulatory action.
The limitations are in place right now.
Besides directing the entity from “cease and desist” from financing activities, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it is separately examining any possible regulatory violations and deficiencies on the part of the banks concerned.
JM Financial Products has been allowed to continue to service its existing loan accounts through the usual collection and recovery process.
In a statement, the RBI said the actions were “necessitated due to certain serious deficiencies observed in respect of loans sanctioned by the company for IPO financing as well as NCD (Non-Convertible Debentures) subscriptions”.
The regulator’s latest move also comes a day after it slapped several curbs on IIFL Finance Ltd, including barring it from disbursing gold loans, following supervisory concerns.
Based on information provided by markets regulator Sebi, the RBI had carried out a limited review of the books of the JM Financial Products.
“During the limited review, it was observed, inter alia, that the company repeatedly helped a group of its customers to bid for various IPO and NCD offerings by using loaned funds. The credit underwriting was found to be perfunctory, and financing was done against meagre margins,” the RBI said.
The application for subscription, the demat accounts and the bank accounts, all were operated by the company using a Power of Attorney (POA) and a Master Agreement obtained from these customers without their involvement, whatsoever, in the subsequent operations.
“Consequently, the company was able to effectively act as both lender as well as borrower,” the RBI said.
Further, the central bank said JM Financial Products also acted as the arranger of bank account opening as well as the operator of the said bank accounts using the POA.
“Apart from being in violation of regulatory guidelines, there are serious concerns on governance issues in the company, which in our assessment are detrimental to the interest of the customers,” it said in the statement.
According to the statement, the business restrictions will be reviewed upon the completion of a special audit and after rectification of the deficiencies to the satisfaction of the RBI.
These business restrictions are without prejudice to any other regulatory or supervisory action that may be initiated by the RBI, against the company, it added.
JM Financial Products offers a broad suite of loan products. Broadly, it operates under five verticals – capital market financing, retail mortgage financing, bespoke financing, financial institution financing, and real estate financing, as per its website.

The
layoffs, which could continue in the coming days, have affected various departments, with the branch banking segment being particularly impacted. Those who have been let go have received a severance package equivalent to three months' salary.
This decision by the bank is significant as it marks the first instance of a private sector bank conducting layoffs in several years.
In contrast, other private sector banks have been actively recruiting staff in recent times.
An individual with knowledge of the matter told ET, ""Yes Bank has launched an internal restructuring exercise at the advice of a multinational consultant. So far, around 500 have been asked to go and we can see more sackings in the coming weeks.""
According to reliable sources, the lender is aiming to reduce expenses by focusing on digital banking and minimizing manual processes. The ongoing restructuring initiative is also expected to contribute to lowering the bank's operational costs. In the previous financial year, the lender's operating expenses had increased by nearly 17%.
Between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, the lender's staff expenses rose by more than 12%. The bank spent Rs 3774 crore on staff expenses at the end of FY24, compared to Rs 3363 crore at the end of FY23. As of FY24, the bank employed approximately 28,000 individuals, having added 484 employees in a single year. Over 23,000 of its employees are classified as junior management.

The private lender had undergone a similar process following the appointment of current managing director Prashant Kumar in 2020, after the bank was rescued from collapse by a Reserve Bank of India-led effort. During that period, many senior staff members departed from the bank.

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], October 2: IIFL Finance, which is one of India's largest non-banking financial companies, today said that leading rating agency CRISIL has removed IIFL Finance from 'Rating Watch with Developing Implications' and has reaffirmed the rating at 'CRISIL AA/CRISIL AA-/CRISIL PPMLD AA' while assigning a 'Stable' outlook. The short-term rating has been reaffirmed at 'CRISIL A1+'.
In the rating rationale dated September 30th 2024, CRISIL said, ""The rating action follows lifting of the regulatory embargo on the gold loan business of IIFL Finance, disclosed by the company vide the announcement dated September 19, 2024, thereby allowing the group to resume sanctions and disbursements in this segment as in the normal course of business, as well securitization/ assignment/ sale of loans.""
""The company has demonstrated track record of profitably scaling its gold loan business - which remains one of its core segments. With the regulatory restriction being removed, and the company having taken requisite corrective measures following the action by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the group is expected to focus on regaining its market share in the gold loan business which should support the restoration of its market position and profitability, which had moderated during the embargo.""
RBI had imposed an embargo on March 04, 2024, asking IIFL Finance to cease and desist from sanctioning and disbursing gold loans or assigning/securitising/selling any of its gold loans. After a special audit and other regulatory inspections, the embargo was lifted on September 19, 2024.
CRISIL further said, ""The ratings continue to be supported by the group's comfortable capitalisation, its established track record of operations in home loans and microfinance segments, and sustained profitability metrics, supported by stable asset quality. These strengths are partly offset by limited diversity in the resource profile, with a moderately higher cost of funds vis-a-vis some of the peers.""
Kapish Jain, President & Group Chief Financial Officer of IIFL Finance, said, ""The outlook change and Rating reaffirmation by CRISIL is a validation of our sound business model and our proven track record of building successful and profitable businesses with highest standards of Governance & transparency.""
IIFL Finance offers gold loan, affordable home loan, microfinance loans and business loans and has consolidated assets under management of Rs. 69,610 crore as on June 30, 2024, making it one of the largest retail-focused non-banking finance companies in India. IIFL Finance is present across India through over 4,400 branches and multiple digital platforms catering primarily to the credit needs of unbanked and underbanked small entrepreneurs. IIFL Finance Group is a leading player in gold loan, home loan and microfinance segments.

And, well, during the last six months, our whole focus was, while we were doing other businesses, that is the digital lending, loans against property, but as far as gold lending was concerned, that was our major portfolio.
To be candid with you, for the last two months, we were incurring cash losses every month, every day. So, the whole focus was on rectification. And fortunately, we were able to convince RBI of our stand. But here in response to your question, I would like to say that, well, at IIFL, checking, cross-checking, multiple checking with RBI for rectification.
And I must say that sometimes I used to feel very uncomfortable that once a thing has been checked, re-checked, cross-checked, again checked why these multiple checks?
So, what were the lessons? And before that, I want to talk about the damage in the last six months. You talked about the cash losses, but how many customers did you lose? What were the kind of queries and panic calls that you were getting?
AK Purwar: Very difficult question to answer. We went through an extremely torrid time in the last six months. Many of our customers whose loans got paid off, they simply left us and we were feeling sad that they were leaving us.
It was a very-very difficult time. But as far as lessons are concerned, we learned our lessons. We stand chastened today. Our focus so far during the last 20 years of our existence was on technology that we must have better than the best technology as compared to many institutions who outsource their technology. We have built up a huge in-house team which focuses on keeping our technology up to date, not only up to date, our motto is that we have to be better than the best in the country and comparable to best in any part of the world.
And second focus was on credit quality, that our credit quality, as a banker I always feel that lending business, if you compromise on credit quality, then you cannot sustain for the long term. So, those two focuses were very strongly there.
Now another focus has come. Now that, although we were compliant by and large, we always believed in complying with RBI regulations but now I will personally devote a lot of my time on setting the proper system and processes to ensure that this unfortunate event, which was a big lesson to all of us, never gets repeated again.
Absolutely. It must have been months of a lot of trauma. But now you are heaving a sigh of relief. Brokerage notes are already upgrading IIFL Finance. And I am just going to take away from what Jefferies has to say because they say that the gold loan disbursement will take time to normalise and recover over the next one to two quarters given the fact that there had been customers who switched lenders. It will take time to regain market share. So, how would you like to respond to this in terms of the timeline?
AK Purwar: Well, let me put it this way that before this event, we enjoyed certain market share of the system. To regain that market share will take a little longest time. But as far as our business levels were concerned, as on the date which this event occurred, it is around 23,000-24,000 crores. Our efforts are that by 31st March 2025, we not only regain our absolute level of advances, but exceed those levels.
What I see is your gold loan AUMs had very good growth before this RBI ban. The momentum was about almost 30%. When do we expect this exact rate of growth to come up and will you then have to be a lot more aggressive than how you were given the fact that now RBI has also told NBF to not do more than this 20,000 cash disbursement and I guess that must be a very big impediment.
AK Purwar: Well, let me take your last question first. That yes, the cash disbursement now, we are very explicit, clear that we would not disperse in cash more than 20,000, so that is how the instructions have gone to all.
But I expect that regulators and the government will ensure that there is a level playing field for all of us. It should not be that we do it and rest of the market behaves in a different way.
Otherwise, we shall definitely be a long-term loser. But if a level playing field is there, gets created, then we are sure that well, we will be able to survive.
Two, that as I was telling you, the technology in our organisation is taken as some sort of a religion, technology and asset quality. Technology-wise, when this event happened, we used to disperse 30,000 new accounts every day and out of this 30,000, 80% of customers used to be very small customers, taking loans for housing construction, repairs of the house, for the education of the children, for setting up new business services centres or for agriculture.
Well, now fortunately, we are coming. We have a loyal customer base. But what is most important, distinguishing for us, as I have been repeatedly telling you, is our technology levels. We have the capacity to do 30,000 new accounts day after day, every day, on a sustained basis.
We will focus on improving this further. And I am very confident and sure that in six months' time, we will not only make it up, but we will exceed our old levels.
Secondly and crucially, this has been a big lesson for us and our institution has learned its lessons.
In the next six months to one year's time, we shall take the organisation forward and emerge much stronger than what we have been so far.
Just talking about the impact as well that it had in Q1, naturally your margins were compressed due to this. As you are rebuilding your gold loans, do you see that margin pressure easing? Do you have any numbers in mind as to by how much it should ease?
AK Purwar: I think it is a little too early to make that kind of assessment. At the moment, our whole focus is on firefighting. One firefighting that regulatory we have been able to go through, come out cleanly. Another firefighting to go back to our old business levels. As I was telling you for last two months, we have been incurring cash losses in the organisation.
Now we have to first of all get out of that and simultaneously work on what kind of new verticals we can add to our system, we can add to our company so that we can go back to a high growth long-term on a sustainable basis.
Ensuring two things, asset quality has to be top quality, better and the best in the system. And two, that our technology level should be top-notch, which facilitates making these kinds of businesses for us.
First things first, on the customer loss that you talked about, how is it that you are going to get the trust and those lost customers back and add on to your customer base?
AK Purwar: Well, it is a challenge. But it is a challenge and there is a hidden opportunity also. We have to rebuild our brand. Fortunately, there is not much damage to that because our old loyal customer base still stands with us. Fortunately, our key personnel, they have still continued in the organisation. So, rebuilding that may be a little slow process, but I think it should happen over the next couple of months’ time.
But we have to aggressively work on attracting new kinds of customers, new verticals and new business and that is where once this gold loan comes back on that is where our whole focus is going to be on. But let me tell you at the risk of repetition, IIFL will emerge much-much stronger post this event.
You also talked about some employees who did leave you in this when you were braving the battle in the last six months. They were not the top-level employees?
AK Purwar: Fortunately, yes. They were not top-level employees. None of a single top-level employee has left us. You see the organisation we have created, our organisation is a lot more democratic and we believe in taking care of our people. I would put it this way, some of them not senior level, but mid-level, junior level have left. We understand their problem in the sense that well suddenly their fluctuating pay or variable pay is no more there.
So, today it forms a very important component of the total package which an employee gets. So, now it is undergoing a change. Once we are back on race perhaps some of those good employees who have gone, they might like to come back but that is the process.
The other thing of course is your company also raised money from several investors right after the ban, Fairfax being one of those. How is it that you are going to reward your investors now?
AK Purwar: Well, we are grateful to Fairfax in the sense that well when we were going through an extremely challenging, demanding, tough times, their vote of confidence, their monetary support stood us very well.
But law does not permit me to pay them beyond the stipulated contracted rates of interest. So, we will pay that. But, of course, their trust of confidence in us has substantially strengthened our relationship and trust with them and we will definitely work towards improving our relationship which is mutually rewarding in times to come.
Any other investors because from what I see is that IIFL Finance is going to completely have a new makeover of sorts, it is going to be a very new and improved IIFL Finance 2.0 if I can call it that. That will require people, that will require investment in technology, that will require lots. So, any fundraise, any new investors, anything that you have in mind right now?
AK Purwar: The restrictions that have been withdrawn only yesterday. We have just started breathing a little easy. Give us time.
And would you want to give this messaging as well, this vote of confidence that you are talking about now to some of the ratings agencies as well, the likes of ICRA, CRISIL, etc, who had put your rating under watch, negative or said that there are developing implications. Would you be meeting with them or want to change that perception now?
AK Purwar: Definitely, we will work on that. But first of all, our first priority is to bring normalcy to the institution. As soon as the normalcy starts, our cash losses start going away. And I am sure that from this month onwards, cash losses should go away. And well, we would be definitely engaging with them to have a comprehensive review of the ratings which they have done.
And this has also come at a time when the festive season is just approaching us, so can we say that now there are some stronger opportunities that you are looking at with the festive season around the corner?
AK Purwar: Absolutely. You see for us, for an institution like ours, once this ban is lifted, believe me, every day is an opportunity and festive season is much bigger opportunity. So, it is definitely an opportunity and we are going to work on it and see to it that well. We come back and start growing at the same pace or maybe a higher pace in times to come.
So, next six months, you will manage to clock back those 23,000 crore rupee AUM?
AK Purwar: More than that.

IIFL Home Finance's CFO, Gaurav Seth outlines plans to achieve this ambitious growth through strategic partnerships, geographic expansion, and a focus on maintaining affordability for customers in challenging economic times.
The AUM of IIFL Home Loan is set to reach Rs 42-43 thousand crores by the end of this fiscal, and Rs 1 lakh crore in the next 3 to 4 years, said Gaurav Seth as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in an exclusive interaction with ETCFO.
The CFO talked about company’s long-term financial goals, investments required, and the recent partnerships.
During the interaction, Seth also shared the strategies he intends to implement to ensure the products remain affordable for customers in the current economic climate.
Here are the edited excerpts:
Q. What are the financial targets for IIFL Home Finance by the end of FY 2025?
As of September 30, 2024, IIFL Home Finance is at an AUM of over Rs 37,000 crores, and we are growing at around 20% on a YoY basis.
We expect this growth to continue and the AUM to reach Rs 42-43 thousand crores by the end of this fiscal.
In terms of profits, we expect a similar growth of around 20% in this financial year, reaching the range of Rs 1200 to 1250 crores.
Our NIM is around 7.5%, and we expect it to be in the same range.
For ROE, we are in the range of 16%-17%, and expect it to steadily grow up as year progresses to around 17%-18%.
Q. What are your long-term financial goals?
In terms of AUM, we are forecasting to become a Rs 1 lakh crore company in the next 3 to 4 years.
Today we have around 77% of Home Loan, and 2%-3% of construction financing. In terms of Loan Against Property, we have it at 22%-23%.
Since the Home Loan is a low-yield product, and Loan Against Property is a high-yield product,a change in the product mix will result in an improvement in our blended yields and NIM’s. In the longer term, we expect the Home Loan to go down to 72%-73% while the Loan Against Property to go up.
Q. What kind of investments do you anticipate necessary to achieve your long-term financial goals?
Currently, we are at around 49% CRAR. From a CRAR perspective, we do not need any capital.
However, we will continue to invest to grow my business.
Over the last 2-3 years, we have invested heavily on infrastructure. We have opened nearly 250 branches in Tier II and III towns.
We believe now the benefits of these investments need to flow in for over 2-3 years.
Once we reach a satisfactory level, in terms of returns and productivity, that will be the time when we will think of the next phase of investments.
We are going to redeploy our profits and not looking for fresh capital.
In terms of borrowings, we expect that we need to borrow in the range of 35 to 50 thousand crores in the next 2 to 3 years.
This amount will be utilised for two purposes. One is growing the loan book and second is the repayment of the existing loans.
There are multiple facets of borrowing. One is the National Housing Bank (NHB) from which we have approx 25% of our existing borrowing. Second is the term loans that we take from the banks, the third is the DFIs and fourth is the NCDs.
Q. What is the status of your Rs 3000 crore public NCD issue?
We have filed for a Draft Shelf Prospectus, and now we have to file the final prospectus and then go for the IPO.
We have not decided on a final date, but we would like to do it by the end of Q3 and early Q4 of this financial year. Further details like the tenure and size will be revealed close to the issue date.
Q. With your recent partnership with ITC to address the home financing needs of farmers, are there any more strategic collaborations in the pipeline? What criteria do you consider when forming such partnerships?
We are a $4.5 billion affordable housing company catering to the deepest of the towns of the country.
While forging partnerships, we look at two things. Firstly, our partner needs to help us to go deeper and take places where banks are not lending because our target is EWS and LIG.
There are a couple of partnerships that we will sign during this quarter. All of these are built on two premises: one is to take us deep enough and the other is who are large enough.
Q. As CFO, what strategies do you intend to implement to ensure that your products remain affordable for customers in the current economic climate?
When we look at the housing finance industry, there are a few things to consider. One is the yield that I am getting, the cost of funds, and the credit cost.
However, there is a very important fourth element, which is ‘What is the cost?’
Compared to peers, cost is something that we are very focused upon.
We have the lowest Opex to AUM ratio at 1.9% which is nearly half as compared to the industry. This also enables us to be very competitive on the yields being offered.

IFC will subscribe to a senior debt instrument, structured as a green bond, to be issued by Tata Cleantech Capital in one or more tranches.
Funds raised through green bonds are used to finance environmentally friendly projects such as renewable energy generation.
Tata Cleantech, a joint venture between Tata Capital Ltd and IFC, will use the proceeds to finance wind, solar and other climate projects that meet the green bond eligibility criteria. Tata Capital owns 80.5% in the Mumbai-based company; IFC holds the remaining 19.5% equity.
“The green bond will be structured to be compliant with Green Bond Principles, 2016, and TCCL is expected to become a signatory to the green bond principles,” IFC said in the disclosure.
The principles are essentially guidelines that govern the process of selling green bonds and the standards of transparency and disclosure that issuers must follow.
Tata Cleantech identifies, evaluates and funds projects in the renewable energy sector including solar, wind, small hydro and biomass, energy efficiency and water treatment segments. It has funded over 80 renewable energy projects with a total capacity of 3,500 MW.
Tata Cleantech funded Mumbai’s largest solar rooftop project, installed at the National Centre for Performing Arts (NCPA) by Avesta Solar Private (ASPL) last month. It disbursed a total of Rs2.36 crore to the project.
IFC has an active direct private equity-style investment practice, apart from lending to firms in India. It also has a limited partner portfolio; it backs PE and venture capital funds focused on India.
India’s renewable energy sector has seen a lot of activity over the past couple of years after the government set up ambitious capacity addition targets of achieving 175 giga-watt (GW) of renewable power generation capacity by 2022, including 100GW of solar and 60GW of wind power capacity. India’s renewable energy capacity is currently around 44GW.
In February this year, IFC proposed to invest up to $15 million (Rs100 crore) in renewable energy service company Clean Max through compulsory convertible debentures.
Last year, IFC decided to facilitate debt funding worth around $177 million for Ostro Energy Pvt. Ltd, a renewable energy platform backed by emerging markets-focused private equity major Actis.",review_promoted,sample

""My view is in next 5-6 years you will see death of physical banks. It will be very difficult for physical banks to survive because the cost of physical banks will be so enormous.
It will be so enormous compared to an online instrument, many of the fintech start-up and their ability to do data analysis (and) providing lending,"" Kant said at an IAMAI event.
He said that with proliferation of mobile phones and Internet based transaction, it will be easy for financial technology firm to do analysis and provide loans to person who requires it and has good credit history.
""Amazing thing is that a lot of this going to happen because India will become data rich before it becomes rich. Our ability to use technology, analyse data and able to reach and provide financial inclusion to people in rural area will be key drivers of growth,"" Kant said.
He said that India is now home to about 900 financial technology players and received funding of $3 billion. This is forcing Indian banks to transform themselves riding on wave of Fintech.
""There is lot happening in India because of Internet. We have leap frogged US technology industry with very simple and practical innovation. Cost of customer acquisition in India fell down to $1 where across America and Europe the cost of acquiring is between $28-30,"" Kant said.
He said that in last 45 years about 28 bank licences have been issued by the government, but within last 18 months about 21 payments bank licences have been issued.
In 2015, the RBI had granted 'in-principle' approval to 11 entities, including the Department of Posts, to set up payments banks and proposed to give such licences 'on tap' basis in future.
However, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company, Tech Mahindra and a consortium of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries promoter Dilip Shanghvi, IDFC Bank and Telenor Financial Services gave up their plans to roll out payments bank.
Out of the remaining eight companies in the fray,
Airtel, India Post Payments Bank and Chinese firm Alibaba backed
Paytm have launched their commercial operations.Other players are - Aditya Birla Nuvo, Fino PayTech, National Securities Depository,
Reliance Industries and Vodafone m-pesa.
Kant said Indian government is making things easy and simple for businesses.He, however, was annoyed when director of a company complained about processes at government offices and problem in online transactions in India.
The NITI Aayog CEO said he agrees with the point raised but in last three years lot of things have started changing.
""I have been in government for long time to realise that in the last 3 years a lot of attempt has been made to make India very easy and simple,"" Kant said.
He cited new reforms like goods and services tax, bankruptcy laws, enabling company to register in a day etc.
""You and me have to change India. All of us have to be part of that change. But, people when they live abroad, come to India for 10 days and start criticising everything about India, that's not done,"" Kant said.",review_promoted,sample

This is the second such NCD issue by the company in the last two years. “We have doubled our issue size and the confidence has come from the positive sentiment in the rural economy auguring well,” said the company’s Chief Financial Officer V Ravi.
He further added that the issue will be split between four categories of investors — qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), corporates, high net worth individuals and retail individuals — and will be offered in three tenures – seven, 10 and 15 years.
For QIBs and corporates, the coupons on offer are 7.75 per cent, 7.90 per cent, and 7.95 per cent, respectively. For the other two categories, the rates offered are higher at 7.85 per cent, 8 per cent, and 8.05 per cent respectively, payable annually.
Monsoon to drive growthMahindra Finance Managing Director Ramesh Iyer said: “Drought and demonetisation have impacted the rural market. However, with better-than-expected monsoon this year, we are expecting good growth. The sentiment will continue to remain good.”
Infrastructure and farm-related cash flows are important and expected to support rural growth, he pointed out.
“We are expecting to maintain 20 per cent growth this year also,” Iyer said, adding that last year growth was slightly impacted by poor monsoon and demonetisation. Edelweiss Financial Services, AK Capital Services, Trust Investment Advisors and YES Securities are the lead managers to the issue.

[caption id=“attachment_3900957” align=“alignleft” width=“380”] Representational image.[/caption] MobiKwik recently inked an agreement with Bajaj Finance under which the latter invested Rs 225 crore (about USD 35 million) in the digital payments company for a 10.83 percent stake. “We had said that we plan to raise about USD 150 million and this investment (from Bajaj Finance) is the first tranche. We are in talks with private equity and venture capitalists to raise over USD 100 million,” MobiKwik Co-Founder Upasana Taku told PTI. She added that more funding is expected to come in during the latter half of the year. The deal with Bajaj Finance values the company at over USD 300 million. MobiKwik has so far raised over USD 85 million in funding from investors like South Africas payments major Net1, Sequoia Capital, American Express, Tree Line Asia, and Cisco Investments. It claims to have a network of more than 15 lakh direct merchants and over 55 million users. Talking about the Bajaj Finance partnership, Taku said the two companies will collaborate to launch many “sector- first and industry-first services” on its app. Under the agreement, Bajaj Finance will acquire 10 equity shares and 271,050 compulsory convertible preference shares (CCPS) of MobiKwik. Post conversion of the CCPS, Bajaj Finance would hold about 10.83 per cent of equity in MobiKwik. The conclusion of the transaction is subject to fulfilment of certain conditions in due course. Interestingly, last month, MobiKwiks rival and Snapdeal owned FreeCharge was sold to Axis Bank in a Rs 385 crore deal. **Digital payments have gained significant traction** after the governments decision to ban high-denomination notes in November last year. Mobile wallet companies like Paytm and MobiKwik have witnessed **significant growth in number of users** as well as volume of transactions on their platforms.

L&T Finance was one of the worst performing NBFCs till last year. How did the turnaround happen?
There were 3-4 things that we focused on. First, the cost from very heavy structure, which was taking away our nimbleness. As an NBFC, we had to be nimble and fast.
Second, we had too many businesses. There were businesses that had no hope of scaling up and we were losing money. We were in construction equipment, cars, where others could do better than us. We were in businesses like tractor and infra, where we did well. My plan was to get the right business with right structure and reduce complexities. I stuck my neck out to say that we will achieve top quartile RoE by 2020.
We are an L&T company and we were supposed to be the best. I will say forget best, we were one of the worst NBFCs in the country. On every metric, whether RoE, shareholder return, profitability; we were in the bottom quartile of NBFCs. We started implementing the strategy from April 2016.
risk management, and hence we've been able to grow fearlessly.
How did you control costs?
You've grown your disbursements by 30-40%. Is that sustainable?
Till FY2015-16, we were not good at so many things, and hence, we had slow growth. In FY17, we concentrated on five products. We've said we'll outperform the market. If the market is growing at 10%, we'll grow at 20%. We'll do better than competition. In the past year, we spent a lot of time in strengthening our balance sheet by making a lot of provisions, putting systems and processes in place and investing in digital and analytics. It helps us take better decisions, quicker. It has given us confidence that we can grow without accidents happening. I am calling it growing fearlessly. Today, after having worked on these projects for four quarters, I am confident, we'll grow at a healthy pace.
What checks and balances have you put in place to ensure accidents don't happen?
As a CEO, I have to be very careful. I can't do anything that is temporary.I went to a risk consultant. We are in lending business, so we have to take some risk. We have put a risk dashboard for every level. We have put an early-warning signal in every product.
We have put strong liability-side buffer. If by September, a black swan event happens and liquidity dries up in the system, like it had happened twice in the past 10 years for two days each, we're building a 30-day liquidity buffer. We believe there is low probability of accidents happening.
What are the strengths that you want to focus on?
In lending, we are focusing on housing and infra, and in non-lending, mutual fund and wealth management. We have put a few filters: industry attractiveness -is it growing fast; do we have a selling proposition; and over the full cycle, whether we will be making money.
After demonetisation, interest rates came down. We had realised that net interest margin is not going to be our strength. We completely moved focus from keeping loans in our balance sheet to underwriting, processing, managing those loans and selling it to the banks. We changed the metric from NIM to NIM plus fee income. We have to see how we can be better than competition.
Which are the businesses where you have burnt your fingers?
Our Infra book is about `32,000 crore, out of this legacy portfolio booked before 2012 is around `9,000 crore, of which `3,500 crore is impaired. We are taking provisions in this portfolio. Thus we have come to a stage where there is no sizeable risk in the balance sheet. Infra financing continues to be our strength, which we will continue to grow substantially.
Businesses, which we stopped doing after taking large hit, are commercial vehicles, construction equipment and cars. When we started running down this portfolio it was `5,500 crore, and today it is `2,500 crore.
Are you looking to list any of your businesses?
My strategy is clear about creating shareholder value for L&T Finance shareholders. For growth, I need capital. A lot of capital will come from internal accruals. Over the next 3-4 years, we will need certain capital if the balance sheet is growing at 20% and generating an RoE of 18%.
How is L&T helping in the restructuring?
They are 65% of our shareholding and they sit on our board and they have to approve the plan. L&T brand name helps in getting employees.Group synergies help in raising funds. I have a credit rating of AA but I raise funds at almost AAA because of L&T. We get appointments easily and actual client referrals.
Are you looking to apply for a universal bank license?
Under the current set of rules, we don't want to apply.

However, the foreign brokerage cut earnings per share (EPS) forecast, accounting for transient NIM (net interest margin) pressures with valuations reflecting higher CoE.
In its report, Morgan Stanley said that both short-term and long-term market borrowing rates are up since September 2017, while State Bank of India's one-year retail term deposit rate is down 35 basis points and MCLR is up only 15 bps higher.
It expects a return to equilibrium over the next 12-18 months. But Morgan Stanley believes that the delay will test NBFCs, especially HFCs (competing with banks in all of their loan segments).
""We like M&M Financial Services, Shriram Transport Finance, Bajaj Finance and Edelweiss Financial and have overweight rating on these stocks. We like NBFCs structurally; however, we expect most to de-rate over the next year, since rising rates are negative for sentiment,"" it said. ""Investors are likely to be cautious in the early stages of a rising rate cycle. Our preference for NBFCs over the next year will be below corporate and private retail banks.""
The brokerage cut Indiabulls Housing Finance and Aditya Birla Capital to underweight mainly for lower relative upside potential. It is of the view that return on equity (ROE) will be in back in fashion as the key valuation metric over high top-line growth.
The greatest P/B–ROE disconnect is being seen at PNB Housing Finance and AB Capital. However, LIC Housing Finance is at attractive valuations for the medium term and the brokerage has an overweight stance on the stock.
But the near-term concern is volatility in interest rates. Morgan Stanley has an equal weight on Shriram City Union Finance as some clarity on capital deployment .
It is of the view that NBFCs that operate in traditional non-bank segments, which is with differentiation in product or customer segment, will be back in vogue rather than asset aggregators. With cost of equity rising, ROE should gain importance as the key valuation metric over top-line growth.
Morgan Stanley expects certain businesses like Bajaj Finance and Edelweiss Financial Services to continue to trade at premium multiples with sustained delivery and visibility of high growth and high ROE.

L&T Finance is a subsidiary of L&T Finance Holdings.
L&T Finance’s supply chain finance business employs 50 professionals and operates out of 16 cities in India.
“As part of our strategy, strengthening our SME lending business is a key focus area for us. The supply chain finance business is a fast growing area and we wish to increase our presence in this space. This acquisition will be a natural fit in our portfolio and will be a profitable accretive business in the first year itself,” Ranjan Ghosh, MD & CEO of Centrum Financial Services, said.
“It will also give us lucrative cross selling opportunities. We plan to infuse additional capital and are confident that the acquired L&T Finance team will play a significant role in helping us grow the business,” he added.
L&T Finance’s supply chain vertical provides working capital finance to entities that are suppliers to large industrial manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The company, with a combined customer base of about 800, also provides channel finance and inventory finance to dealers.
“This move is in line with L&T Finance’s dual objective of concentrating on our core strengths and retailisation of our overall lending book. Within the wholesale finance book, we continue to focus on the renewables, roads and transmission sectors, where we have built a leadership position,” Virender Pankaj, CE – Wholesale and Group Head – Sell Down, L&T Financial Services (LTFS), said.
The Centrum Group, through its NBFC, offers commercial finance, structured credit, supply chain and real estate finance to SMEs and MSMEs. Its other lending services include affordable housing finance and micro finance. In November 2017, it had acquired the micro finance business of FirstRand Bank India and took on board its 300 employees and 25 offices.

IL&FS recently defaulted on inter-corporate deposits and commercial papers to the tune of about Rs 450 crore, bringing it under Reserve Bank of India scrutiny and getting hit with debt rating downgrades. While the commercial papers commitments were honoured with a few days lag, it failed to repay the deposits of Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) in full.

The Sensex opened at 37,278.89 which rose to 37,489.24 during initial hours of the trading but soon it took a great plunge of 1,495.6 points and crashed to the low of 35,993.64. Later on it recovered some lost ground and closed at 36,841.60 registering a fall of 279.62 from the day's opening.
Some of the banking as well as housing finance companies stocks saw severe beating today which dragged the markets down. Among housing finance companies, Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL) stock was the worst performing. Today DHFL share opened at the price of Rs 615.60 and saw a huge decline of 42.43% and by the end of the day it closed at Rs 351.55. Many other HFC stocks also fell to record low level during the day. HFC stocks such as Indiabulls Housing Finance cracked 14.84 per cent, Reliance Home Finance fell 18.30 per cent, Gruh Finance fell 17.66%, Repco Home Finance dropped 12.08 per cent, PNB Housing Finance saw a fall of 9.23%, LIC Housing Finance fell by 14.84 per cent and Bajaj Housing Finance saw a fall of 19.96% per cent.
As per media reports, the selloff in DHFL was the primarily triggered by a rumour that DHFL is likely to see a downgrade in its debt papers as one of the prominent mutual fund house sold papers worth Rs 200-300 crore of DHFL at discount. The market feared of a poor liquidity in the debt market. This triggered a major selloff in housing finance companies and Dewan Housing Finance was one of the worst affected. However, experts feel there is no reason for panic and housing finance companies are in a good position.
""This is one kind of an impact that has happened and I don't see anything that has changed overnight for housing finance stocks which could justify such correction,"" Rahul Shah, Vice President, Group Leader-Equity Advisory, MOFSL. ""I don't see any pain in the papers of the good rated companies. Mostly they are very strong, or have very strong parents,"" he added.
Experts believe that IL&FS default has also dented the sentiments regarding the liquidity conditions in the market. But these are short-term volatility and investors shouldn't worry about it. ""The uncertainty surrounding future of IL&FS and therefore liquidity conditions are souring sentiment. Though these issues appear to be transient they can be a source of significant volatility in the short term,"" said Vinay Khattar, Head, Edelweiss Investment Research.
DHFL CMD Kapil Wadhawan has come out with clarifications that the company has no exposure to IL&FS Group and the debt papers of the company haven't seen any downgrade. ""Our borrowing is well diversified with a banking consortium of 31 banks, NCDs, CPs, ECB and masala bonds. We are one of the deposit taking HFC with a public Deposit portfolio of Rs10803 crores. Our ratings on any of our debt instruments or fixed deposits are neither under watch nor there is any down grade in the existing credit rating. DHFL enjoys high credit rating of CARE AAA (Triple A) and has been assigned BWR AAA from Brickworks Rating. There is also no regulatory issue or concern with respect to the company,"" said Mr Wadhwa in a press release.
He also clarified on the asset quality of the company. ""Our Asset quality is strong and we have registered lowest NPAs in the industry and have reported Gross Stage 3 Loan Assets (equivalent to Gross NPA%) at 0.93%. The testimony of our investor's trust in the organization was proven by 3 successful NCDs,"" he added.
In terms of asset quality majority of Housing finance companies are better placed than some of the troubled banks which are grappling with the non-performing assets (NPAs) problem. Housing finance companies lend with tangible collateral and their NPAs are much lower than most of the banks. One of the best performing banks HDFC had a gross NPS of 1.30 per cent in the quarter ending March 2018 so DHFL with less than one per cent of gross NPA does not appear to be bad. The gross NPA of many other HFCs barring a few like HUDCO, are well within the reasonable range and less than 2% while many of the troubled banks have registered gross NPAs in double digits.
Therefore, there is no apparent reason for investors who have invested in HFCs to get into panic. You may utilise this correction to review your exposure into HFC stocks and build up your positions in good HFC stocks, believe experts.",review_promoted,sample

IL&FS has defaulted on its debt repayment obligations and efforts are on to find a solution, which will focus on bolstering the financial situation of the company. “The contagion has to be contained…the regulator should not step in for solvency problem. For liquidity problem, the regulator should step in,” he told PTI on the sidelines of a banking industry event in Mumbai. In a bid to quell concerns over shortage of cash, the RBI Thursday morning said that there is surplus liquidity in the system, and it will ensure durable liquidity by using various available instruments depending on market conditions. [caption id=“attachment_5129811” align=“alignleft” width=“380”] Representational image. Reuters[/caption] Gandhi cited the RBI action on providing liquidity support as the right approach. When asked about the regulatory and supervisory processes and if such a situation could have been avoided, he first said institutions should have the resilience to take the impact of a few bad commercial decisions, and also pitched for allowing institutions to fail if required. “We created that expectation (that financial institutions will not fail) because of the public sector banking system that everything is the government, and its own institution cannot fail. That is a wrong expectation; individual commercial institution if they are failing because of their own fault, let them fail,” he said. He added that as the non-bank lenders do not accept deposits, the level of regulatory scrutiny on them is lower. Gandhi said the impact on the larger public if an NBFC like IL&FS were to go down, is limited to the mutual fund investments by the common public, and added that other stakeholders in the company are institutions. The banking system exposure is also limited, he said, asserting that they can bear the reverses caused in case of any event. Gandhi said the systemic trouble will also not be very high if IL&FS were to go down, pointing out that NBFCs constitute only 15 per cent of the overall finance sector, of which, 7 per cent is held by three top companies promoted by the government. When asked if the RBI has become extra vigilant as seen in the cases of curtailing the terms of the chief executives at Axis Bank and Yes Bank, Gandhi said the action is not unprecedented and it rejects names “very often”. On the issue of data localisation, he said storing of copies of transaction locally should suffice. “So long as a copy of the transaction is available, any security-related concerns can be easily addressed,” he said, adding that if any foreign firm like Whatsapp finds the local requirements onerous, an indigenous alternative offering the same service can emerge. On the Wednesday’s Aadhaar judgement by the Supreme Court, he said it will not have any adverse impact on banks.",review_promoted,sample

Brokerages expect a turnaround in the NBFC space as the new governor could adopt a more lenient stance on liquidity issues the sector is facing. The development comes as a relief for the markets as NBFC stocks have been battered since October.
“The scenario in NBFCs could improve as the Street is expecting the new governor to be more lenient, compared to his predecessor,” said Suresh Ganapathy, head of financial services research, Macquarie. “There are already talks about possible interest rate cuts and softer monetary policy, both of which will benefit NBFCs.”
Among the key gainers is Indiabulls Housing Finance, which climbed 7 per cent. Shares of Canfin Homes and MAS Financial Services gained 8 per cent and 8.5 per cent, respectively.
Muthukrishnan added that within the NBFC space, asset lenders are expected to do better than housing finance companies as they offer loans for shorter durations. Companies such as M&M Finance, Sriram Capital, and Bajaj Finance are the key listed players in the asset lending space.
Brokerages also prefer bigger NBFCs to the smaller players.
“The larger NBFCs did not have many problems, especially on account of better asset liability management, while the smaller ones may still have problems,” said Joseph Thomas, head of research, Emkay Wealth Management. “The incremental business by way of fresh loans is already affected due to liquidity problems in the case of smaller entities.”
Along with the NBFCs, shares of state-owned banks are also seeing an uptick after the change of guard at the central bank. For the past two sessions, State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank stocks gained.
The Street expects the new policies to help in recapitalization of state-owned banks. However, analysts aren’t convinced. Nonperforming assets (NPAs) continue to be the key challenge for state-run banks. Although, aggressive provisioning and improved recovery efforts have improve things for these lenders, analysts say it is still early to predict the turnaround in these banks.
“We are still negative on public sector banks on account of serious asset quality issues,” Ganpathy added.

Mumbai
LENDERS dumped shares of Anil Ambani group companies they held as collateral after their market value plummeted about 126 billion rupees (S$2.4 billion) this month, adding to the litany of woes plaguing the Indian billionaire.
Creditors sold a total of 5.5 billion shares in four companies - Reliance Power, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Communications and Reliance Capital - leading to a 3 to 8 percentage-point reduction in founders' stakes in these firms, according to filings.
The fragile investor sentiment for the Anil Ambani group was dealt another blow after its wireless unit, Reliance Communications, said last Friday that it plans to file for bankruptcy.
The selloff spread to other group firms, eroding the value of the shares pledged as collateral. IDBI Trusteeship Services Ltd, which held Reliance Power shares, said it sold the assets as the borrowers ""defaulted on the terms"".
Reliance Communications has seen its market value drop by more than half this week, while shares of Reliance Power and Reliance Infrastructure have crashed almost 60 per cent each. Reliance Capital has tumbled 34 per cent.

Both L&T Finance and Edelweiss Group refuted the allegations by the Reliance Group.
A few Non-Banking Finance Companies, ""substantially L&T Finance and certain entities of Edelweiss Group, have invoked pledge of listed shares of Reliance Group and made open market sales of the value of approximately Rs 400 crore from February 4 to 7,” the group said in a statement.
It was not clear who had pledged the shares.
“The illegal, motivated and wholly unjustified action by the above two groups has precipitated a fall of Rs 13,000 crore, an unprecedented nearly 55 per cent, in market capitalisation of Reliance Group over just these four short days,” it noted.
In that period, shares of Reliance Power plunged 62.1 per cent, while those of Reliance Infrastructure dropped 58.6 per cent, and Reliance Capital fell 38.6 per cent.
The Reliance Group said the actions have caused substantial losses to 72 lakh institutional and retail shareholders, and harming the interests of all stakeholders.
Citing legal advice, the group also said the purported exercise of rights to enforce the security is illegal and excessive, and against the process and requirements of the respective borrowings' documentation.
""The manner of conduct of the above open market sales... is also illegal on several counts, including amongst others, price manipulation, insider trading, front running and market abuse, and is in violation of various regulatory provisions...,"" said the statement issued during market hours.
Further, the group said that Reliance Capital, Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Power as well as their various subsidiaries are performing satisfactorily on all operating parameters, and there is no change whatsoever on any aspect as compared to the position prevailing prior to these sales.
Refuting the allegations, L&T Finance said it had granted loans against pledge of shares to Reliance ADAG Group companies.
""As per loan and pledge agreements, borrower did not cure various events of defaults including providing margin for shortfall in the stipulated security cover. ""Despite various notices in the past few months, events of defaults continued. Consequently, L&T Finance enforced its rights of invocation and sold pledged shares to the extent of its outstanding dues by following the due process of contract and law,"" it said in a statement.
While noting that the allegations as ""unfounded, baseless and false"", Edelweiss Group said it had granted credit facilities against pledge of shares to Reliance ADAG Group.
Edelweiss Group said it has reached out numerous times to Reliance ADAG Group to address concerns on shortfall in margins and resultant fall in collateral valuation.
""Despite our best efforts, not only did Reliance ADAG Group fail to address any of the concerns raised by Edelweiss Group, but also continued to breach contractual obligations,"" it said in a separate statement.
On February 4, there was a sharp drop in the prices of Reliance ADAG group shares, which led to further erosion in the collateral value, Edelweiss said, adding that it also gave due opportunity for remediation. “Since there was no response from Reliance ADAG Group, it necessitated liquidation of the collateral as per the agreed contractual terms. Throughout this process, Edelweiss has acted in a lawful and responsible manner,” it added.
The group also said that plans by RCom to resolve its debt through the National Company Law Tribunal had no adverse impact on the three companies in question.

In 2009, Aggarwal started accepting bookings for several projects in the city, some of which were SRA, some redevelopment projects, and some new constructions like the one in Saki Naka, promising flats by 2013.
Days after the high court allowed flat buyers to take over as developers of Orbit Corporation’s luxury housing project, Orbit Terraces, another group of homebuyers want to follow suit. Nearly 150 flat buyers of Orbit’s budget housing in Saki Naka, Andheri, have approached the HC to take over the stalled project.
Flat buyers of Orbit Residency Park, a project with 281 flats spread across six buildings in Saki Naka, approached the court last week, willing to buy back their project which is currently in possession of LIC Housing Finance Limited, a nonbanking financial company. The bank took over the mortgaged project after Orbit Corporation led by Pujit Aggarwal defaulted on loans.
In 2009, Aggarwal started accepting bookings for several projects in the city, some of which were SRA, some redevelopment projects, and some new constructions like the one in Saki Naka, promising flats by 2013.
For this, Aggarwal took loans from several banks and non-banking institutions. He took a loan of Rs 325 crore from LIC Housing Finance Limited for three projects – Orbit Residency, Orbit Grand, a luxurious redevelopment project in Lower Parel and another project in Lalbaug. He also used these projects as security against his loans.
However, by 2015, after making part payment, Aggarwal had defaulted on most of his loans. With Rs 87 crore of the principal amount still pending, residents of Orbit Residency and Grand have now offered the bank a one-time settlement of Rs 45 crore – Rs 30 crore to be paid by Orbit Residency and Rs 15 crore by Orbit Grand, which is only 20 per cent complete.
The residents had first approached the court in 2017, after which Orbit Corp went into liquidation. When the HC order on Orbit Terraces went the residents’ way earlier this month, flat buyers of Orbit Residency filed a fresh application, through lawyers Raval Shah and Co, with lawyer Rishab Shah as counsel.
One of the buyers is 57-year old Suhas Masoorkar, who had booked the flat for his ailing mother. She passed away in 2016. “We are a joint family of eight members. I had booked the flat after selling one of our two rooms, especially because my mother had a kidney problem and we only had one bathroom.”
However, with the project stuck, Masoorkar’s entire family was forced to live in the single room left. “Eight people, a 550 sq ft room and an ailing mother, it was a nightmare. My mother’s condition kept deteriorating and she passed away in 2016.”
On February 17, Mirror had reported on the Bombay High Court’s order accepting Orbit Terraces’ residents’ proposal to develop the buildings by raising money on its own. The flat purchasers had earlier reached a Rs 63 crore settlement with the banks.

Positive global cues only made the climb easier.
The bulls took charge as foreign institutional investors kept the funds flowing into India. Rupee's rising trajectory and expectations of Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking power again kept the pitch conducive to more upside.
Numbers tell the story. The BSE Sensex advanced a whopping 1,353 points to 38,024 during the past five trading sessions. The broader NSE Nifty rose 391 points, or 3.55 per cent, to 11,427.
The return gift
As many as 32 stocks on the BSE500 managed to deliver over 10 per cent returns during the week gone by. The list featured stocks such as Himatsingka Seide (up 23 per cent), CG Power (21 per cent), Manpasand Beverages (18.55 per cent), Dilip Buildcon (17.41 per cent), Westlife Development (16.96 per cent) and Edelweiss Financial Services (15 per cent).
Stocks that cracked
Only four stocks plunged in double digits. Reliance Communications slipped 25 per cent, followed by Sterlite Technologies (14 per cent), Take Solutions (12 per cent) and Future Consumer (11 per cent). Reliance Power, Inox Wind, The Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Linde India, Swan Energy and Reliance Capital went down over 5 per cent during the week.
IPO update
MSTC: The initial public offering by state-owned MSTC has been extended till March 20 and the price band has been lowered, according to a regulatory filing. The price band of the offer, which was to close on Friday, has now been revised to Rs 120-128 from Rs 121-128 per share.
Embassy REIT paces up: Embassy REIT has allotted 5.81 crore shares in the upper band of Rs 300 per unit, aggregating Rs 1,743 crore, as part of the anchor investor allotment. The initial issue of REIT will open on March 18 with a price band of Rs 299-300 per unit and will close on March 20. The IPO is expected to raise up to Rs 4,750 crore.
TCIL eyes listing: State-owned Telecommunications Consultants India (TCIL) expects to raise roughly Rs 1,500 crore from its planned IPO and wants to retain part of the proceeds -- about Rs 600 crore -- for expansion and working capital needs, according to a company source. The proposed IPO is likely to hit the market sometime in the middle of this year, according to PTI.
Sectoral update
Sector-wise, the BSE Realty index as well as Bankex rallied more than 5 per cent during the week. Other indices including the BSE Oil, Telecom, Capital Goods, Power, Consumer Durables and Healthcare jumped 1-4.50 per cent. ""Public sector banks are expected to report net profits of Rs 23,000-37,000 crore during FY20, after four consecutive years of losses, even though overall profitability will remain weak with return on net worth (RoNW) of 4-6.3 percent,” rating agency Icra said in a note.
Top Nifty gainers/losers
With a gain of over 10 per cent, IndusInd Bank and HPCL emerged as the leader of the Nifty pack. However, Tech Mahindra (down 1.49 per cent) and UltraTech Cement (down 1.41 per cent) took the top losers tag. HPCL gained after media reports that the department of public enterprises is in the process of conferring Maharatna status to the company.
NBCC
Shares of NBCC rallied 15 per cent during the week after the state-owned firm said it has secured an order worth Rs 700 crore from Raipur SMART City.
Midcaps, smallcaps show fatigue
While the benchmark equity indices rallied over 3 per cent, BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices advanced 2 per cent for the week ended March 15. Among the second rung stocks, Indo Coun Industries, The Byke Hospitality, Steel Exchange India, Alok Industries and Adlabs Entertainment firmed up over 25 per cent last week.
IDBI Bank
IDBI Bank has been categorised as a private lender following acquisition of majority stake by Life Insurance Corporation, the RBI said. In January, LIC completed the process of picking up a controlling 51 per cent stake in the nearly crippled IDBI Bank. “IDBI Bank has been categorised as a 'private sector bank' for regulatory purposes by the Reserve Bank of India with effect from January 21, 2019, consequent upon LIC acquiring 51 per cent of the total paid-up equity share capital of the bank,"" RBI said in a statement on Thursday. Shares of the lender came down by 1.15 per cent to Rs 42.90 from Rs 43.40 during the period under review.
RCom on a sticky pitch
Shares of Reliance Communications cracked 6 per cent on Friday following reports that the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is invoking bank guarantees to recover Reliance Communications’ (RCom) latest spectrum dues. DoT is invoking bank guarantees to recover RCom's latest spectrum dues and is set to issue a notice asking why the airwaves shouldn’t be withdrawn, adding to the woes of the telco whose chairman Anil Ambani faces jail for not paying a vendor, an ET report suggested. Shares of the company plunged nearly 25 per cent for the whole week.
Stocks @ fresh new high
As many as 22 issues on the BSE500 index scaled their fresh lifetime highs. The list includes stocks such as Tube Investments, UPL, Info Edge, ICICI Bank, Trent, HDFC Bank, Titan Company, Bata India, Muthoot Finance, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank.

Following the closure of the transaction, ATC’s stake in ATC TIPL — the second-largest private telecom tower firm in India with a portfolio of about 80,000 mobile towers — will be close to 90 per cent. The remaining stake in the company will be held by funds owned by Macquarie.
“This is an extension of the earlier signed deal, when TTSL sold nearly half of its stake to ATC in October 2018. TTSL has an option to sell the remaining stake, which must be exercised in this financial year,” a source close to the development said.Separately, sources in DoT also confirmed the development. While ATC declined to comment, TTSL could not be immediately contacted for comments.
Last year, TTSL had offered to sell 50 per cent of its total stake while another stakeholder, IDFC, sold its entire stake in ATC’s tower unit for ₹2,940 crore. The companies, redeeming their put options, offloaded the stakes to ATC.
Separately, TTSL, which merged its consumer mobile businesses with Bharti Airtel in a cashless deal in 2017, paid ₹2,368 crore to ATC as one-time settlement for closing down nearly 30,000 telecom towers.
In October 2015, ATC bought a 51 per cent stake in Viom Networks from TTSL and SREI Infrastructure Finance for ₹7,635 crore, and later renamed the company ATC TIPL.

The IIP slide began in late 2018, thanks to tepid domestic and world demand. It touched a 21-month low in March 2019, marked by a dip in growth of capital and consumer goods. As a result, IIP growth in FY 2019 was down to 3.6 per cent, against 4.4 per cent last year. The Finance Ministry’s Monthly Economic Report for March 2019 observes that “India’s economy appears to have slowed down slightly in 2018-19. The proximate factors responsible for this slowdown include declining growth of private consumption, tepid increase in fixed investment, and muted exports.” It is important to get a fix on the problem. It could be a result of endemic demand deficiency, deepened by demonetisation, and later made worse by the crisis in the NBFC sector sparked by the implosion of IL&FS and others. In hindsight, it is not clear whether the remonetisation of the economy resolved the woes of small firms hit by disruption of working capital cycles and their inability to repay debt.
The fact that the IBC mechanism has not been able to release locked assets quickly could have added to the uncertain investment scenario. It is, however, true that there were feeble signs of an investment pick-up in 2018-19, reflected in higher credit offtake by corporates from SBI and ICICI Bank ( BusinessLine , May 12). While signs of a pick up in credit growth are encouraging, these are early days. It is not clear whether the rise in both bank credit offtake and external commercial borrowings by corporates will translate into greenfield investments. Meanwhile, the knock-on effects of IL&FS and DHFL need to be grasped. For an economy that rides on construction and automobiles, this is a serious prospect. The economy needs to be put back on an assured growth trajectory. Even the CSO’s second advance estimates of GDP growth for 2018-19, at 7 per cent, based on a manufacturing growth of about 8 per cent, seem optimistic. Whatever the quibble over data, the fact is that the period from 2003-04 to 2010-11 was one of faster growth compared to the subsequent one. The fact that gross domestic savings and gross fixed capital formation have fallen steeply from 36 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively, of the GDP just before the GFC, to below 30 per cent now tells a story.
Banks went on a credit binge during the first phase, and unviable infrastructure was created. We are dealing with legacy NPAs, with infirmities in the financial sector still haunting us. It is ironic that a government that introduced sweeping reforms such as the bankruptcy code and GST has failed to keep growth going in a period of benign commodity prices. Countercyclical policy steps need to be urgently taken.

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is concerned about liquidity issues facing some Indian non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) such as mortgage or auto lenders and wants to ensure the problems do not become a systemic issue, two sources told Reuters on Wednesday.
After its central board met on Tuesday, the RBI said it had decided to form a separate supervisory and regulatory cadre in the bank after reviewing the institution's current supervisory structure.
The central bank is hoping to use banks to support NBFCs and it will look at options to strengthen risk management systems at these companies, said the sources, who asked not to be named as they are not authorized to discuss the matter with media.
The RBI's board discussed various means to tackle the liquidity problems in the NBFC sector and it has decided to handle it in a ""nuanced"" manner by improving liquidity and tightening regulatory norms without sending a ""panic"" signal to the market, said a senior official, directly aware of the discussions.
Another source said the board was concerned about the liquidity situation, but felt it was not right to call it a ""systemic issue"".
""There is no liquidity crisis. There are select NBFCs whose balance sheets are under strain and the entities, or banks who were lending are not lending to them anymore or are lending at much higher rates,"" the second source said. ""It's not across the entire spectrum of NBFCs.""
The RBI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The discussion comes even as Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL) - an NBFC that is one of India's largest home loan lenders - said it has stopped taking new deposits and blocked premature withdrawals after a credit rating downgrade, dragging down its shares and those of other NBFCs on Tuesday.
EASING LIQUIDITY
The RBI officials and board members are worried defaults by some of the NBFCs could hurt the economy and financial markets, but RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das made it clear the RBI cannot directly provide any help to the sector, both sources said.
The RBI could instead announce a raft of measures including another round of forex swaps soon to inject liquidity into the market, as part of ""nuanced"" attempts to handle the issue.
Earlier in May, three sources had told Reuters that the RBI would likely conduct another forex swap after the general election, along with further quantitative easing measures to boost liquidity and lower borrowing costs that remain stubbornly high despite the RBI's recent policy rate cuts.",review_promoted,sample

Global financial services firm UBS Securities, in a report, has stated that while many investors are concerned about the ongoing financial tightness led by the NBFC sector and its impact on discretionary consumption that could further slow down the overall economic growth, it is not a “systemic risk”.
UBS’s NBFC analyst highlighted that delayed monetary transmission and subdued mutual fund flows could result in a further slowing of the NBFC sector, but large players with strong parents and track records are better positioned, compared to the smaller players in the segment.
“Small NBFCs could lose market share, with a sharper slowdown for mid-sized and small housing finance companies (HFCs). We maintain our view that this is not a systemic risk, although the negative feedback loop driving the latter merits tracking,” said Tanvee Gupta Jain, Economist, UBS Securities India Pvt Ltd.
IL&FS defaults
The gloomy situation in the NBFC segment at present is a spill-over impact of defaults by IL&FS, followed by an alleged financial fraud at housing finance company Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL).
Earlier this month, DBS had stated that the concerns over non-bank finance companies are also spilling over into the credit space.
Non-banks face an overhang of rating downgrades, higher cost of borrowings and narrower pool of funding channels.
Meanwhile, with the new government in place, it is unlikely that the RBI will create a dedicated credit line to struggling NBFCs, as underlying problems are more solvency-driven, rather than due to a shortage of liquidity, said DBS.

The Reserve Bank of India Thursday said it is closely monitoring the developments in the NBFC sector and will not hesitate to take measures to ensure financial stability.
This comes in the backdrop of two domestic rating agencies downgrading commercial papers of debt-laden DHFL.
The country's largest lender SBI too said it has been closely monitoring its exposure to the NBFC sector for the past 10 months and taking action as required.
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, during his post policy interaction with the media, said the apex bank is closely monitoring the troubles brewing in the NBFC sector due to the liquidity crisis.
Stating that the RBI is committed to ensuring a robust and well-functioning NBFC sector, Das said, ""The central bank will not hesitate to take whatever steps are required to ensure that the financial stability is not adversely impacted in any manner by any development.""
The comments came following a bond repayment default by Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL), the third- largest pure-play mortgage player, and the resultant rating downgrades of its Rs 850 crore commercial papers to default grade by Crisil and Icra.

Later in a statement, SBI said the overall quality of the NBFC asset portfolio on its books continues to be good.
""Challenges faced by accounts like DHFL have already been factored in when we have given our estimate for the stress that the Bank would have to deal with in FY 19-20 and included in our estimates for slippage and loan loss provisioning for the current financial year,"" it said.
Refuting the credit rationale, DHFL said the action by the rating agencies is extremely surprising as the company has been making and continues to make substantial efforts in ensuring no defaults on any bonds and repayment of its financial obligations.
""These actions are unwarranted and the company is seeking clarification on the rationale that predicts DHFL's inability to service pay outs on the due dates. Such speculative rating rationale is not adequate,"" the housing finance firm said in a statement.
Since September 2018, DHFL has repaid close to Rs 40,000 crore of financial obligations, it said.
To ensure adequate liquidity to meet the repayments, DHFL also sold its strategic retail assets including Aadhar, Avanse and DHFL Pramerica Asset Managers, it said, adding that the company is committed towards ensuring repayment of all its obligations.
Following the rating action, shares of DHFL plummeted nearly 16 per cent. The scrip tanked 15.86 per cent to close at Rs 93.90 on the BSE. During the day, it dived 18 per cent to Rs 91.50 -- its 52-week low.
Crisil in a note Wednesday said the downgrade to 'default' or 'D' reflects delays in debt servicing by DHFL on some of its non-convertible debentures (NCDs) because of inadequate liquidity. The payments were due on June 4, 2019.

The RBI's stance failed to cheer investors as the looming crisis in the non-banking financial companies (NBFC) sector overshadowed the move

The benchmark indices posted their biggest single-day decline of 2019, even as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lowered policy rates by 25 basis points (bps) — a move that was widely expected.
The central bank cut rates for a third time this year, and kept the option open for further easing to boost growth.
The RBI’s dovish stance failed to cheer investors as the looming crisis in the non-banking financial companies (NBFC) sector overshadowed the move.
Most investors were hoping that the central bank would announce some measures to help alleviate the crisis in the NBFC sector.
The Sensex ended at 39,529.72, down 554 points or 1.38 per cent, on Thursday, while the Nifty lost 178 points or 1.48 per cent to close at 11,843.75. This was the biggest single-day fall for both indices since December 21, 2018.
All the 19 sectoral indices compiled by the BSE ended the session with losses. The BSE Bankex and BSE Finance indices declined over 2 per cent each.
Most NBFCs dropped over 7 per cent, while the Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL) stock fell 16 per cent after rating agencies lowered its rating to ‘default’.
“With the recent news around DHFL and the possible contagion effect, several financials corrected heavily. However, I believe that the market will soon take cognizance of the change in policy stance to accommodative. This dovish policy opens the doors to another rate cut in 2019,” said Amar Ambani, president and research head, YES Securities.
The benchmark indices had closed at record highs on Monday, anticipating a rate cut. With the latest 25 bps cut, the repo rate has reached a nine-year low.
“Even though the RBI changed the stance to accommodative, the leg room for further rate cuts is limited. Further, the repayment delay by DHFL is way too big a strain for the market, considering the IL&FS default itself remained unaddressed for 10 months. Markets have turned risk-averse due to worries associated with contagion risk,” said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of research at Centrum Wealth.
On Thursday, both domestic as well as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net sellers. FIIs sold shares worth Rs 416 crore, while their domestic counterparts took Rs 355 crore off the table.
Banking stocks were among the biggest losers among Sensex components. IndusInd Bank and YES Bank fell by more than 6 per cent each, followed by State Bank of India, which shed above 4 per cent.
Experts said that a big upmove in the markets would depend on policy action by the government.
“What the finance minister speaks before the Budget will be keenly watched by the market. That will give us some clue on whether the budget will have policies to revive growth. Further, whether the government brings big bang announcements is what investors are keen to know,” said Andrew Holland, Avendus Capital Alternate Strategies.",review_promoted,sample

New Delhi: Investor wealth eroded by Rs 2.22 lakh crore on Thursday as markets recorded their biggest single-day fall this year after RBI delivered a rate cut on expected lines, but failed to assuage concerns regarding the NBFC sector. The 30-share BSE Sensex plummeted 553.82 points, or 1.38 per cent, to close at 39,529.72.
Tracking weak sentiment in the broader market, the market capitalisation (m-cap) of BSE-listed companies tumbled Rs 2,22,304.65 crore to Rs 1,53,19,126.66 crore. ""Nifty had rallied in the recent days, leading up to the RBI policy. With a 25 basis points repo cut widely anticipated, indices corrected post the announcement. A possible reason of the fall could also be that there was no mention in the policy about addressing the liquidity stress in the NBFC space.
""With recent news around DHFL and the possible contagion effect, several financials corrected heavily today. However, I believe that market will soon take cognizance of the change in policy stance to accommodative,"" Amar Ambani, president and research head, YES Securities said. The broader NSE Nifty plunged 177.90 points, or 1.48 per cent, to end at 11,843.75.
Home, auto and other loans may cost less as the Reserve Bank on Thursday cut interest rates for the third time this year to their lowest level in nine years. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent and reverse repo rate by an equal proportion to 5.50 per cent and expected banks to transmit these to home, auto and other loan borrowers faster.
From the 30-share pack, 21 companies closed with losses, led by IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, SBI, L&T, Tata Steel and M&M. All BSE sectoral indices ended in the red, with oil and gas, bankex, capital goods and finance falling up to 3.04 per cent.

Equity benchmark indices oscillated between gains and losses on Friday, a day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) marginally reduced key interest rates and serious funding challenges appeared to cripple non-bank financial institutions.
However, the BSE S & P Sensex closed 86 points higher at 39,616 while the Nifty 50 gained 27 points to 11,871. The rally was largely by IT and financial stocks.
At the National Stock Exchange, sectoral indices of bank, financial service, IT and private bank were in the green. But Nifty pharma was down 1.2 per cent. Auto, FMCG, metal, PSU bank and realty also closed in the red.
Among the prominent gainers were IndusInd Bank, State Bank of India, Bajaj Finance, Bharti Infratel, and Bharat Petroleum Corporation.
But shares of Eros International Media fell further by 14.4 per cent, a day after tumbling nearly 20 per cent after CARE rating agency cut its creditworthiness citing delays or likely defaults in serving debt availed from banks.

Home loan lender Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) too slid further by over 11 per cent despite reassuring comments from its management pertaining to payment of interest obligations.
On Thursday, it dropped 15.86 per cent after rating agencies ICRA and Crisil slashed their outlook on the company's commercial paper programme. Fitch Ratings said DHFL's liquidity problems highlight the funding challenges faced by non-bank finance sector.
Among other losers were Dr Reddy, Yes Bank, Cipla, Powergrid and JSW Steel.
Many investors believe the RBI's move to cut interest rates marginally is unlikely to stimulate demand in the near-term due to the absence of quick resonance in financial market.
Besides, the central bank did not give any clear stance as far as non-banking financial companies are concerned.
Meanwhile, Asian shares traded mixed as investors awaited a key US jobs report and the outcome of further tariff negotiations between the Trump administration and Mexico.
Shares in Japan and South Korea were little changed. Markets in Hong Kong and China are shut for holidays. Japan's Nikkei firmed 0.3 per cent.

The Andhra Pradesh crisis that led to the promulgation of the AP Ordinance 2010 had severely impacted its ability to service debt, leading it to CDR (corporate debt restructuring); about half of its portfolio was from the State.
Incurring substantial losses (owing to provisions relating to the AP portfolio), the company failed to meet the RBI’s minimum net-owned funds (NOF) requirement, and its capital-to-risk weighted asset ratio (CRAR) turned negative as of March 2015 and March 2016. Aided by profits generated by its non-AP portfolio, the company was able to restructure its debt and raise funds from lenders and exit CDR in March 2017. Capital infusion from Kangchenjunga — the company’s corporate promoter (currently holding 59 per cent stake) — and Kedaara AIF – 1, enabled the exit (with the issue of negative net worth being addressed).
Demonetisation in November 2016 also impacted the company — the total loan outstanding that are overdue for 90 days or more (excluding the old AP portfolio) stood at 6.9 per cent of loans in FY17. This has come down to 0.1 per cent in FY19. The company has about ₹360 crore of old AP portfolio on its books, which has been entirely provided for.
While over the past two years — after coming out of CDR and weathering demonetisation — Spandana’s assets under management (AUM) grew sharply, it has come on a low base (after a rough patch between 2012 and 2016); sustainability of this growth needs to be monitored. Also, 95 per cent of its portfolio pertains to the rural segment, making it more vulnerable to risks. Spandana offers loans predominantly to women from low-income households.
Valuation
Against this backdrop, the asking price for Spandana IPO is not cheap. At the upper band of ₹856, the IPO values the company at about 2.4 times the FY19 book (post issue) and about two times FY20 book (post issue). This assumes a 30-40 per cent growth in earnings, on a low base. Satin Creditcare Network — the second-largest MFI — trades at about one time FY20 book value. CreditAccess Grameen — the third-largest MFI — trades at about 2.5 times the FY20 book value; a good track record of growth and profitability has aided Grameen’s valuation.
Given Spandana’s rocky performance in the past, exposure to riskier rural segment, limited track record of sustainable growth in AUM and profit, the IPO appears pricey. Investors can avoid the issue and monitor the performance over the next year, before considering investing.
The IPO is a combination of fresh issue of shares worth ₹400 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) for 93 lakh equity shares.
Business performance
Spandana offers loans to women under the JLG (joint lending group) model without any collateral. These loans focus on areas such as agriculture, agriculture allied activities, small-scale activities etc. and constitute 84.6 per cent of the company’s gross AUM, as of March 2019. Other categories of loans, comprise 15.4 per cent of AUM.
The company’s AUM fell by 6 per cent in FY16, lagging others such as Satin Credit and Grameen that grew their AUM by a robust 50-70 per cent. Post exit from CDR in 2017, the AUM growth zoomed to 144 per cent in FY18 and 34.7 per cent in FY19. Profit-after-tax in FY19 has grown by 66 per cent with return on equity at 19 per cent.

Retirement fund manager EPFO on Wednesday approved appointment of UTI AMC and SBI Mutual Fund as its fund managers for three years, according to a source.
Besides, the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) also approved a proposal for early redemption of its investment of around Rs 700 crore in bonds of troubled Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL), at its trustees' meeting held in Hyderabad.
""The EPFO's apex decision-making body Central Board of Trustees (CBT) headed by Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar has decided to appoint two fund managers UTI AMC and SBI Mutual Fund for a three-year term,"" the source said.
The source further said, ""The CBT also decided to exercise early exit option for redeeming its investment of around Rs 700 crore in bonds of DHFL.""
The proposal to double minimum monthly pension Rs 2,000 under the Employees' Pension Scheme, 1995, was deferred as employees' representative demanded for higher amount, the source added.
The EPFO's advisory body Finance, Audit and Investment Committee (FAIC) had finalised and recommended the names of three asset management firms -- HSBC AMC, UTI AMC and SBI Mutual Fund -- for their appointment as fund managers for three years beginning October 1, 2019.

The appointment of the fund managers for another term of three years had been pending with the EPFO since April last year. The body had appointed SBI, ICICI Securities Primary Dealership, Reliance Capital, UTI AMC and HSBC AMC for three year, starting April 1, 2015.
Thereafter, the EPFO gave many extensions to the five fund managers. Now, the extended term of the five fund mangers would expire on September 30.
The EPFO had appointed multiple fund managers for the first time in July 2008 for earning better rate of return on deposits for its subscribers. Before that, SBI was the sole fund manager for the retirement fund body since its inception in 1952.

“On September 12, real estate-focussed non-banking financial company (NBFC) Altico Capital India Ltd., defaulted on a scheduled interest payment on a loan because of insufficient liquidity. Although Indian banks’ exposure to Altico Capital is fairly modest and accounts for less than 0.1% of total banking system loans, the default signals increasingly tight liquidity among property developers, a credit negative for Indian banks, given their significant exposure to the real estate sector,” Moody’s said.
“We believe Altico Capital is facing liquidity constraints because of a deterioration in the credit quality of its loans to real estate developers, which are facing difficulty in repaying and refinancing their maturing obligations as a result of slowing property sales,” it said.
Moody’s said Altico Capital’s default came after Dewan Housing Finance Ltd. defaulted on its loan obligations in July because of insufficient liquidity, raising questions about its solvency.
“Among the banks we rate, Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank have the largest direct exposure to the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, and would be susceptible to asset quality difficulties if the real estate sector continues to slow,” it said.
Other rated private sector banks such as ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are also significantly exposed to the sector, it said.
Indirect exposure
Indian banks also have indirect exposure to the real estate sector through their lending to NBFCs and HFCs, which also lend to real estate developers. Based on data from the Reserve Bank of India, the overall exposure of NBFCs and HFCs to the real estate sector was only about 6.0% of their total assets as of March 31, 2019.
However, some NBFCs and HFCs are more exposed than others, making them vulnerable to a slowdown in the sector.

The case relates to fixed deposits worth Rs 750 crore allegedly misappropriated by the bank in connivance with Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh. The bank is disputing it.
The matter dates back to November 2016 and February 2017 when Lakshmi Vilas Bank received Rs 750 crore by way of fixed deposits: Rs 400 crore in November 2016 and Rs 350 crore in February 2017. On both occasions, two fixed deposits were created making it 4 accounts in all. Their total worth to Religare Finvest Ltd, which is the firm that made the investments, is Rs 790 crores including the interest on the sums deposited.
Religare Finvest Ltd, promoted by the Singh brothers was sold by them. On a complaint filed by the company, the Economic Offences Wing of the Delhi Police has filed a case (FIR) and is pursuing the investigations.
Lakshmi Vilas Bank claims the FDs were offered as security to the bank against loans disbursed to RCH Holding and Ranchem, two entities promoted by the Singh brothers. This was not known to the Religare management and they were surprised to receive a letter from the bank in December 2017 asking the company to execute documents to securitise the FDs against the loans. Religare says it immediately wrote back to the bank that the FDs are not supposed to be held as lien against any loan and that the total amount of Rs 724 crore that the bank had debited to its account be reversed in the books.
Religare considers this case as one of wilful misappropriation by the former promoters in collusion with the bank LVB officials (who have also been named in the FIR). They have created a series of complicated financial transactions and deprived the company of this huge sum of money. The company has stated in its complaint that documents have been executed from its side on offering the FDs as security against any loan and as such the loans have not been availed by Religare Enterprises or Religare Finvest Ltd.
The company says the funds are public shareholders’ money and misappropriating is a serious crime. One of the brothers Shivinder Singh has stated that he himself had brought this issue to the notice of Religare in September 2018 and he had no role in the alleged misappropriation.
The bank has not issued any statement beyond stating that it has received a copy of the FIR and will consider the legal options before it. LVB says the complaint against the bank is false and frivolous and has been made with the intention to malign the bank’s reputation. However, the bank will have to explain and produce evidence to establish that it had followed the normal banking procedure of obtaining the company’s corporate approvals (read board resolution etc.) before creating the FDs as securities against any loan it may have sanctioned.",review_promoted,sample

RCom itself sought bankruptcy early February after its efforts to sell spectrum to Reliance Jio failed due to regulatory delays. The telco had in 2018 entered into an agreement with Reliance Industries to sell its spectrum for Rs 25,000 crore.
It can also be noted that it was RCom itself that had created troubles for Anil Ambani in the recent past, with regard to its dues to Ericsson, which had successfully sought Supreme Court's intervention to make the company pay Rs 577 crore.
Anil Ambani was personally staring at being jailed for contempt of the Supreme Court for a failure to pay the sum and had to be bailed out by his elder brother Mukesh Ambani hours before the close of the apex court-mandated deadline for payment.

This comes as the company stares at a potential fall-through in its merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank, analysts said.
Private-sector lender Lakshmi Vilas Bank is the latest to face struggles in an already troubled banking sector, with the central bank taking regulatory action last week for high level of bad loans and lack of sufficient capital to manage risks, among others.
Indian police have also started probing Lakshmi Vilas Bank's directors for alleged misappropriation of funds.
Indiabulls Managing Director Gagan Banga on Monday tried to assuage investors, saying the Reserve Bank of India's action on Lakshmi Vilas Bank ""does not shut the door on the merger"".
Shares in Indiabulls, which traded at 1,440 rupees at their peak in January last year, gave up early gains on Tuesday to fall as much as 11.8% to 225.65 rupees, their lowest since March 2014.
The stock logged its worst ever daily loss on Monday with a 34% drop, and has lost over 70% this year as of last close.
An Indian court has also ordered a probe into Indiabulls on allegations of illegalities, violations and siphoning committed by its promoters, subsidiaries and their promoters, reports said. Indiabulls has denied the allegations.
""If the company (Indiabulls) continues to face headwinds from negative sentiment, it may potentially face challenges raising fresh funds,"" Macquarie Research said in a note.
The banking industry, which is going through a tumultuous time plagued by issues including high levels of bad loans, took a big hit last year after a major infrastructure conglomerate collapsed, straining liquidity in the sector.

Piramal Capital and Housing Finance (PCHF) and PHL Fininvest Pvt Ltd (PHLF) will issue Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) offering 10.50 per cent through a special purpose vehicle called ‘Master Trust 2019 Series I’.
MUMBAI: The Piramal Group’s real estate financing arms are in the process of raising about Rs 2,400 crore through a structured debt deal that will offer a new credit line to billionaire Ajay Piramal’s two financial services companies focused on the property business.
Piramal Capital and Housing Finance (PCHF) and PHL Fininvest Pvt Ltd (PHLF) will issue Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) offering 10.50 per cent through a special purpose vehicle called ‘Master Trust 2019 Series I’. For the Piramal companies, a large corporate group is said to have given its investment commitment to the PTCs, market sources said.
“The Piramal Group is likely to have sealed the deal through this structured funding, which would be a huge support for such borrowers that were looking to raise money,” a senior executive with knowledge of the matter told ET.
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), select local banks, and corporates normally invest in such types of PTCs.
The instruments are rated AA+ (SO) by rating company CRISIL. SOs, or Structured Obligations are an additional support to an entity’s creditworthiness. Investors would receive interest payments on a monthly basis.
The Piramal Group did not reply to ET’s queries.
PCHF and PHLF are group companies of the listed entity, Piramal Enterprises Ltd.
These PTCs are backed by a pool of corporate loans given by both companies. Normally, retail loans are linked to structured deals. These would be one of the few rare deals where institutional loans have formed the pool.
The transaction is backed by a pool of 52 loans from 33 unique groups. The top 10 groups account for 62 per cent of the total loan pool, which is concentrated in Mumbai, the National Capital Region (NCR), and Chennai. More than 80 per cent of the loans are in the property sector, CRISIL said in its rating rationale.
Catalyst Trusteeship Ltd has been appointed the trustee to monitor the transaction on behalf of investors in these PTCs.
Non-payment of monthly interest or principal will not be construed as default on the PTCs, which would mature in the next two-and-a-half to six years. The investments would be categorised as default only if investors do not receive interest payments and principal in full by the final maturity date.
The real estate sector has been facing a cash crunch as non-banking finance companies (NBFC), the major source of funding to the sector, drastically reduced fresh exposure. Many property developers are finding it hard to complete projects, and some have skipped loan repayments.
Financial stress at two propertyfocused NBFCs, Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL) and Altico Capital, has raised concerns about the real-estate exposure at even the best-rated lenders in India.

“The Piramal Group is likely to have sealed the deal through this structured funding, which would be a huge support for such borrowers that were looking to raise money,” a senior executive with knowledge of the matter told ET.
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), select local banks, and corporates normally invest in such types of PTCs.
The instruments are rated AA+ (SO) by rating company CRISIL. SOs, or Structured Obligations are an additional support to an entity’s creditworthiness. Investors would receive interest payments on a monthly basis.
The Piramal Group did not reply to ET’s queries.
PCHF and PHLF are group companies of the listed entity, Piramal Enterprises Ltd.
These PTCs are backed by a pool of corporate loans given by both companies. Normally, retail loans are linked to structured deals. These would be one of the few rare deals where institutional loans have formed the pool.
The transaction is backed by a pool of 52 loans from 33 unique groups. The top 10 groups account for 62 per cent of the total loan pool, which is concentrated in Mumbai, the National Capital Region (NCR), and Chennai. More than 80 per cent of the loans are in the property sector, CRISIL said in its rating rationale.
Catalyst Trusteeship Ltd has been appointed the trustee to monitor the transaction on behalf of investors in these PTCs.
Non-payment of monthly interest or principal will not be construed as default on the PTCs, which would mature in the next two-and-a-half to six years. The investments would be categorised as default only if investors do not receive interest payments and principal in full by the final maturity date.
The real estate sector has been facing a cash crunch as non-banking finance companies (NBFC), the major source of funding to the sector, drastically reduced fresh exposure. Many property developers are finding it hard to complete projects, and some have skipped loan repayments.
Financial stress at two propertyfocused NBFCs, Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL) and Altico Capital, has raised concerns about the real-estate exposure at even the best-rated lenders in India.",review_promoted,sample

The company has also appointed retired Army officer Lt Gen Syed Ata Hasnain as an independent director on the board of the company, it said in a statement.
Anmol has been on the board of Reliance Capital since August 2016, while the younger one, Anshul joined group this January, and has been actively involved in all operations of RInfra, including a special focus on the defence business, working closely with the group chairman and Punit Garg, executive director, the company said.
As of July 2019, four group companies alone, excluding the bankrupt telecom arm, were sitting on a debt pile of about Rs 93,900 crore.
A company spokesman attributed the induction of the junior Ambanis to respect the wishes of the shareholders who during the recent AGM asked the management to get fresh blood into the company by bringing them on board.
During the recent AGMs, Ambani had said the group was shuttering the two lending arms of Reliance Capital-Reliance Commercial Finance and Reliance Home Finance with a cumulative asset of over Rs 25,000 crore--by December.
On Monday, the group nearly exited RCap's AMC business--which used to lead the market for long and now has gone down a distant fifth slot--to Nippon Life of Japan which now owns 75 percent in the company and has since been renamed as Nippon Indian Mutual Fund for a collective investment of Rs 6,000 crore.
The group has long ago existed the telecom business and the company, once a leading player, RCom is in the bankruptcy court since February. Many other group ventures like the defence vertical are also struggling for long now.
The group's defence business, Reliance Naval is also under severe financial stress.
At the AGM, Ambani had blamed the crisis and the resultant decision to exit to the severe collateral damages the group had taken due to a combination of factors-crisis in the financial services sector, irrational action by auditors and rating agencies and now the slowdown of the economy.
He had claimed that these events aided and abetted by reckless selling and rumour-mongering by vested interest have affected the shareholders of the Group companies. He had also said the group is planning to pay creditors Rs 15,000 crore more by March next year.

Over 90 percent of the project, christened 'Sadaphuli' in Talegaon is completed in six years since it was launched, while the rest will now be completed by buyers who have booked apartments, DSK's financier Tata Capital Housing Finance and a two-member panel appointed by the realty watchdog, Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRera).
Usually, realtors transfer their rights to peers in case of stress, but DSK's difficulties had put question marks over the future for 161 home buyers.
MahaRera on October 22 ordered the resolution under sections 7 and 8 of the state's Rera Act and revoked the registration of the project.
While doing so, it allowed home buyers or the association of allottees (AOA) to execute the remaining construction and register the sale agreements for the project.

The AOA, Tata and the two-member panel has been asked to formulate a blueprint for completion of the project to be submitted by February next year.
The project consists of 279 apartments to be constructed over two phases, and 161 apartments have already been sold.
In the first phase, which includes two towers has total of 184 apartments out of which 100 are already sold or booked. In the second phase, which has 95 apartments, as many as 61 are sold or booked.
Meanwhile, MahaRera has directed to freeze the bank accounts opened by the promoters of the company in Bank of Maharashtra's Pune branch for the project until further notice.
It has also suggested filing a caveat application by the AOA and Tata Capital Housing with the NCLT, Mumbai Bench, to ensure that they are heard and the NCLT is apprised of the efforts of the authority in case of a possibility of an operational creditor, if any, initiating insolvency proceedings against the DSK Group.
DSK Group chairman DS Kulkarni and his wife are currently lodged in Yerawada jail in Pune for allegedly cheating nearly 33,000 depositors and investors of nearly Rs 2,043.18 crore.

The latest reports quoting sources indicate that Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd and Shriram City Union Finance Ltd will be merged with Shriram Capital Ltd thus there will be one single entity with the shareholding in the separate entities adjusted for parity.
The idea is to bring up a fair valuation of the 20% stake in Shriram Capital and 10% in Shriram City Union that the Ajay Piramal led Piramal Group holds. The stakes were purchased by the Piramals some years back when they wanted to ultimately merge the companies with their own. This did not take place for various reasons and now it has been decided that the best way forward is for them to exit the Chennai headquartered financial powerhouse. The third entity, Shriram Transport Finance was also in the equation with Piramal holding 9.97% in it. However, it got sold a few months back for Rs 2,300 crore.
As for TPG, it has 9.4% in Shriram Capital that it wants to sell and move on. After considering various options in the past, the merger option will be taken ahead and there will be one listed company and it will be easy to arrive at a proper valuation for the stakes to be sold. Shriram Capital is being valued at around Rs 25,000 crore, though it is not clear if it is pre or post-merger as proposed.
The value of shares being held by the Piramal Group is put at between Rs 4,500 crore and Rs 5,000 crore. It is reported that Piramal will use the funds realized to pare some debts and to infuse additional fund into its own lending companies.
Though at these valuations, the amount appears large for a single ticket investment, sovereign funds from overseas and PE firms may be keen on making the purchase of these shares from Piramal and TPG. In fact, Advent International, Blackstone Group, CVC Capital, Carlyle Group and Brookfield have already put in their initial bids in August for the stakes held by Piramal and TPG.
Shriram Capital is a large conglomerate with a lot of businesses within its fold. It offers commercial vehicle finance (Shriram Trasport Finance), consumer and enterprise finance (Shriram City Union Finance), runs a retail stock broking firm (Shriram Insight Share Brokers Ltd), deals in life insurance (Shriram Life Co. Ltd), general insurance (Shriram General Insurance), financial product distribution (Shriram Fortune Solutions Ltd) and wealth advisory services (Shriram Wealth Advisors).
The shareholding in Shriram Capital, besides the roughly 30% held between Piramal and TPG, looks like this: South Africa-based Sanlam Group owns 26% and Shriram Ownership Trust and Shriwell Trust hold 30.7% and 13.4%, respectively.",review_promoted,sample

I think there are operators in the market who are taking advantage of that to bring down more and more stocks without looking at the fundamentals,” PEL chairman Ajay Piramal told ET.
The rights issue of around Rs 3,650 crore ($520 million) for existing investors including CDPQ, which owns 2.2% of the company as per the latest regulatory filings, will take place at Rs 1,300 per share and is expected to be completed by the end of February next year. The fresh allotment to CDPQ of Rs 1,750 crore ($250 million) is via a compulsorily convertible debenture (CCD) at a price of Rs 1,510 per share. The conversion into equity shares will happen by end November.
ET had first reported on the fundraising from CDPQ and other investors on October 24.
Piramal said the plan amounted to a vote of confidence.
Prior to this round, the company had raised Rs 2,400 crore by selling its 10% stake in Shriram Transport Finance and is confident of raising more by monetising its Shriram Capital investment.
According to the management, the resources will largely bankroll the fledgling retail loan business as it aggressively diversifies a predominantly wholesale exposure and provide firepower to acquire NBFC assets. The company had explored taking over troubled Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd (DHFL) and had held advanced negotiations before dropping out.
“We are diversifying our book to grow our retail and that would need resources. We also believe that in our existing book, there is still demand from developers for funds and we can address their growth needs,” said Piramal. “Finally, I think there are enough available for inorganic opportunities. Plus, people forget that we have a scaled pharma business too which has grown consistently with margins of 24%.”
Piramal said long-term capital will also help absorb shocks and “fortify” the company against the liquidity squeeze that’s swamped the NBFC space even as the group has consciously stayed away from chasing growth in the past year to conserve capital. It has sharply reduced commercial paper (CP) exposure to Rs 604 crore within a year from Rs 18,000 crore and is confident of making it zero by the end of November. It has also improved the borrower mix in long-term funds of Rs 24,000 crore. Its debtequity ratio is at 2.9 times versus 4.4 times a year back.
Analysts believe risks include its large developer exposure turning into nonperforming assets (NPAs), slipups in execution in custom manufacturing and any unrelated diversification into capital-intensive areas.

Fears of some unknown event hitting India's economic juggernaut, has hung like an oppressive miasma in the air, throughout the year. And yet, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were forced to cover around 1.44 lakh index futures contracts of short positions in the equity derivative segment in just two months -- September and October.
In sheer value terms, the short-covering is a record of sorts, with bearish bets worth more than $1.5 billion being covered by FPIs in index futures alone, experts told BusinessLine.
A bear squeeze can change the market direction suddenly, as traders are compelled to cover their short positions in a fast-changing scenario. When bears are cornered, the indices start moving up rapidly, instead of crashing under the weight of short positions. This is what happened with the benchmark indices, the Sensex and Nifty. Both hit multi-year lows, after crashing around 15 per cent from their lifetime peaks. In September, in just two trading sessions, the indices jumped 8 per cent. Overall, while the Sensex has managed to hit a new peak, the Nifty index is within striking distance of record levels.
In the cash market in October alone, the top 50 listed companies in the Nifty index churned out a total volume of more than 14 billion shares, the highest since the launch of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in 1994. Sentiment in the domestic stock market hit a nadir this year, in a throw-back to the 2008 financial crises, when a fear of the unknown gripped the streets after the fall of Lehman Brothers in the US.
Impact of the NBFC crisis
In 2019, it was the crises of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), the darlings of the stock markets, which caused sentiments to fall. Their business model of lending at high interest rates, that was a strength for several years, suddenly became their weakness, as a few large corporate houses defaulted on their debt. The debt market fiasco of IL&FS and DHFL caused a panic and had a domino effect.
The 2019 crash was different in that a majority of small and mid-cap stocks led the crash. History shows that it is always the benchmark indices that have crashed severely, with the small and mid-cap stocks replicating the fall with a lag effect. Yet, while the Sensex and Nifty were down by only around 15 per cent, it was a 70-80 per cent crash in most small and mid-cap counters that put the fear of God among Indian retail and mutual fund loving investors.
Much of the blame for this should go to an over-enthusiastic SEBI, which led a crackdown of sorts on the price rise in small and mid-cap stocks. The SEBI diktat asking mutual funds to restructure their small and mid-cap schemes was akin to putting a lid on investments in this segment. Also, vague norms relating to circuit filters on small and mid-cap stocks, almost drove investors away from them. FPIs ended up selling stocks worth Rs 4.5 billion in just a few weeks before September on a dooms day prediction, and creating near record levels of short positions.
“The crash in small and mid-cap stocks was so severe, it spread gloom in India, even when the global financial markets appeared resilient. Be it small traders or large fund managers, everyone was reacting to bits and pieces of bad news in the economy or corporate houses. Most of them believed sentiments would translate into a severe crash in the Nifty and Bank Nifty, akin to small and mid-cap stocks. The indices played along, but only up to a certain level. When smart money understood that short-sellers were overshooting their limits, it was the end of the game for the bears,” said Rohit Srivastava, chief strategist and founder, Indiacharts.
On Thursday, when the Sensex touched a new lifetime high after decisively crossing the 40,000-mark, there was utter disbelief and not to mention still present fear in the air. Srivastava says he had been negative on the markets for more than a year and wrote about it in his weekly reports, too, but changed his tone in September.
Central banks change course
""All the ingredients of a market crash, including the sagging GDP print, which hit a low of 5 per cent for the first time in over six years, miscalculations on various counts by the new Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her maiden budget presentation this year and noise around corporate profits seemed like cacophony. The fact that global central banks were changing their course from liquidity tightening to easing was enough to put all other negative factors to rest. Markets are still some way from matching the power of central banks that control money supply and, hence, the bull and bear cycle,"" says Srivastava.
Shaktikanta Das, the former bureaucrat who was appointed Reserve Bank of India Chairman, has never hid his dovish stance. He has cut key interest rates by 25 basis points twice this year and by 37 basis points once. Jerome Powell, the US Federal Reserve Chairman, although he has seemed hawkish, has cut interest rates by 25 basis points three times this year. Importantly, for the first time in more than a decade, the Fed has started cutting interest rates and even commenced enhancing its balance-sheet.
Central banks and Europe and China were easing and Japan has been talking the markets up by threatening to cut, which it will certainly do aggressively when the situation looks grim. It is taking a cautious stance now, to keep the dollar under check. Fear and aggressive buying by Russia, which is trying to move away from the US dollar, took gold to new highs, but that rally seems to have been halted for now. In fact, the position in US gold futures suggest the bulls could have peaked out for now.
Corporate tax rate cut
In India, the GDP may take time to improve, but the markets always move on forward basis. The first short-covering trigger came from Sitharaman, who embarked upon a course correction journey after her Budget misadventure in July this year. After nearly two decades, India cut its effective corporate tax from 35 per cent (even more for certain companies) to 25 per cent (effectively even less for certain companies). If that was not enough, Sitharaman signalled she would do more for markets and even rolled back incremental tax on FPIs. The positive impact of corporate tax cuts is already evident in the profits of some banks and companies in the September quarter results, and brokerage reports have suggested the next two quarters could show the full impact of this.
""Fear still lurks in the market. There is talk that the fiscal deficit could rise due to tax cuts and other measures by the government. But then, it would be a different ball game if the government decides to let the fiscal deficit rise a little, to achieve something more. Anyways, the fiscal deficit was way higher during the previous government. It will not be surprising if the Modi government, too, chooses to dare the rating agencies with elevated fiscal deficit numbers. But a further strong rally from here cannot be ruled out if the government walks the talk on market-friendly tax measures, including rationalising capital gains tax, securities transaction tax and doing away with dividend distribution tax, as is being reported in the media,"" said Rahul Arora, CEO, Institutional Equities, Nirmal Bang.
Lone voices say they still fear bank NPAs, but are clueless when they see that provisioning is not rising and major bad loans were out in the public domain. RBI has opened its liquidity tap, but it is still stuck in banks, which are conservative in lending, Rashesh Shah, Chairman and CEO, Edelweiss Group, told BusinessLine in an interview in October.
Abhiram Eleswarapu, Head of India Equity Research, Analyst at BNP Paribas, told BusinessLine in an interview earlier that he believed the Sensex could touch 43,000 next year, due to the corporate tax cuts, everything else remaining constant.
Experts say it would be tragic if individual tax payers are subjected to a 30 per cent tax rate when corporates were paying 25 per cent. News reports suggest the government is working on it and a package to boost the demand side of the economy could be unveiled, with the only threat being the rise in the fiscal deficit, which Arora says the government may allow for a while.
The story does not end here. Markets are also watching every move of India’s largest company by market cap, Reliance Industries (RIL). It recently announced that its telecom arm, Jio, would be made completely debt-free in a restructuring exercise. Mukesh Ambani, RIL promoter, has already announced that the Saudi state-owned company Aramco, the world's largest oil conglomerate, was keen on buying a stake in his oil assets. The markets are keenly awaiting this, and would cheer like never before when the news is confirmed.

However, one must know that these are not backed by collateral and are unsecured in nature. Investors rely on the reputation and the credit rating of the corporate when investing in them. However, credit rating agencies have gone wrong on ratings multiple times in the past.
The crisis in Dewan Housing Finance Corporation and subsequent helplessness of investors stuck in its FDs hold a lesson. The rating agencies could not detect gradual deterioration in its financials and failed to give advance warning to the depositors. After the issue was already out in the open, the agencies quickly downgraded the company. However, investors got no time to react to the situation. The Bombay High Court had barred the company to make payments to fixed deposit holders without court's permission.
Investors learned it hard way that they should avoid the lure of higher returns and always consider all involved risks. We tell you how you should approach investment into a company fixed deposit.
Avoid if you are a conservative investor
You cannot compare a company FD with a bank FD as latter enjoys deposit insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh and is frequently monitored by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Many a time when banks face a problem, the RBI intervenes with prompt corrective action to bring the bank to normalcy. In the worst case, the RBI also facilitates a merger with strong banks to safeguard depositors. If you are a conservative investor with no wish to take risks, you should stay away from these FDs. ""Corporate FDs carry default risks, that is, the corporate not being able to return the money invested for various reasons. By investing in corporate FDs, one is concentrating funds into a specific company, which is risky for the portfolio. Hence, I do not recommend corporate FDs,"" says Mrin Agarwal, financial educator, money mentor and founder of Finsafe.

Invest only if you understand risks
If you are a financially savvy investor with higher risk appetite and are familiar with risks that these instruments carry then you may consider it under your debt investment portfolio. ""Corporate FDs have similar risks as those in bank deposits. The strength of the issuer defines the risk inherent in these instruments. Leaving aside the insurance cover amount, which is minimal, the fact that corporate FDs offer higher returns can be contemplated since risk-adjusted returns are higher,"" says Sousthav Chakrabarty, Co-founder & CEO Capital Quotient, a Sebi-certified financial advisory firm.
""At comparable risks to a bank, these instruments can yield higher returns. Therefore, these may be suitable for a certain section of investors exploring higher yields in the fixed income space,"" he adds. However, you should put only a part of your debt investment into these FDs.

Do your research before investing
The DHFL example shows that credit rating agencies are not completely dependable, as things may change rapidly not giving you time to react or adjust. If you are investing in a company FD to enhance the return of the debt portfolio, you should thoroughly understand the financial position of the company by checking its financials. Do your own due diligence not only at the time of the investment but also thereafter; you should regularly check the financial performance of the company. You need to make sure that you study their quarterly results carefully. The moment you see any deterioration in numbers, you may exit the company.
Avoid long tenures and concentration
If you are not much confident about the prospects of the company in the long run but still go for the FD, you better invest with a short-term view. For example, if you book the FD for one year, you will get frequent review opportunity and accordingly, you can reduce or increase your exposure. You should also make sure that you do not invest a large part of funds into one company. You can diversify your FDs across multiple companies to mitigate default risks.",review_promoted,sample

The Finance Minister's statement came a day after it was announced that the GDP growth rate of the country fell to 4.5 per cent, slowest in over six years.
""Today, we mark the completion of six months of the second term of @PMOIndia @narendramodi. Several significant steps in structural reforms have been taken in these months. Responses/interventions addressing the needs of the economy will continue"", the FM tweeted in response to a tweet by Prime Minister Narendra Modi Awhich she also retweeted.
""It is 6 months of 2nd term of PM Modi. These #6MonthsOfIndiaFirst have given India a phenomenal reform momentum"" was the tweet from the Prime Minister.
Interestingly, the PM Modi has also listed most economic steps of the government saying India is on track of becoming a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2014.
The target of 5 trillion dollar has come under heavy scrutiny after the dismal growth in the last two quarter marking the six months of the current government though part of the April-June quarter fell into the last government duration which was also the NDA government.
Former RBI Governor and noted economist C Rangarajan has said the 5-trillion dollar target is simply out of question by 2025 at the current growth rate.
As on steps, Ms Sitharaman slashed the corporate tax rate to 22 per cent from 30 per cent for existing companies, and to 15 per cent from 25 per cent for new manufacturing companies. Including a surcharge and cess, the effective tax rate for existing companies would now come down to 25.17 per cent from 35 per cent which involved an outgo of Rs 1.45 lakh crore. Companies can opt for the higher tax rates or the new ones.
The government also brought changes in Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) where now NBFCs with assets worth Rs 500 crore can go for insolvency resolution bringing the finance companies under the ambit of insolvency. It is already notified and DHFL is already in NCLT. This came against the backdrop of the ongoing liquidity crisis in the NBFCs that has also sparked concerns about the overall stability of the financial sector.
Under the NBFC liquidity injection response of the government , there have been steps. Public sector banks have been sanctioned to purchase Rs 21,580 crores of pooled assets as on October 16. Moreover, the National Housing Bank has also extended Rs 30,000 crore worth of credit lines to NBFCs.
Housing sector received maximum attention like NBFCs during these six months. The centre had announced Rs 25,000 crore stimulus package for the ailing real estate sector earlier this month.
Ms Sitharaman had announced that the government plans to give impetus to the housing market to revive over 1,600 stalled housing projects covering 4.58 lakh units and now this window will be operational in two months, DEA secretary Atanu Chakraborty has said.
The PSU Banks have also been capitalised with Rs 55,250 crore bonds. However, credit growth to the industry decelerated marginally to 3.4 per cent in October 2019, from 3.7 per cent in October 2018, according to the Reserve Bank of India's sectoral deployment of credit data.
The government has also taken some steps towards meeting the huge disinvestment target where it took decisions on privatising Bharat Petroleum, Container Corporation and Shipping Corporation of India along with the decision to pare stakes below 51 per cent without losing PSU characteristics. Advisors have been appointed for BPCL and on Air India privatisation, roadshows have been held.",review_promoted,sample

SEBI agreed to settle proposed adjudication proceedings in the case, pertaining to alleged violation of insider trading norms, after it was approached by Ambit Capital with a plea under the settlement regulations “without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusion of law”.
In a settlement order, SEBI said it has disposed of the adjudication proceedings initiated against the applicant — Ambit Capital. It was alleged that Ambit Capital, which is a market intermediary, was in possession of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI) about Manappuram Finance’s quarterly results and the same was circulated to its clients indirectly by way of a negative research report. SEBI conducted an investigation into the trading in the scrip of Manappuram Finance, wherein it was observed in 2012-13 there was negative earnings per share (EPS) during the quarter ended March 2013 wherein the company made a net loss of ₹141.43 crore.
Therefore, the information of negative profit for the fourth quarter of 2012-13 is deemed to be price sensitive information in terms of SEBI’s insider trading norms, the regulator noted.
On March 18, 2013, Manappuram Finance had held discussions with Ambit Capital on the quarterly financial results. After that meeting, Ambit Capital changed its rating of the Kerala-based firm’s stock from “buy” to “under review” and published a research report which was distributed to its clients (broking as well as research) on March 19, 2013, before the market opening hours, SEBI said.

Preference shares were yielding 7.25 per cent (yield-to-maturity) before the Budget, but the gauge is at 9 per cent or above, dealers said. But buyers are rather rare even at such elevated levels.
“Investors are looking to exit from preference shares,” said Vikram Dalal, managing director, Synergee Capital Services. “Investors primarily used to invest in preference shares as dividend income was tax-free up to Rs 10 lakh, and thereafter, it was to be taxed at 10 per cent.”
“Technically, post budget, there is parity between interest and dividend income,” he said.
Triple-A rated secured non-convertible debentures (NCDs) offering 8-8.50 per cent are finding takers. Some AAA-rated bonds by Tata Finance, L&T Finance, M&M Finance and other credible conglomerates appear to be the first choice of investors.
“After DDT, incremental money is not flowing in, but looking for secured, listed bonds,” he said.
Investor interest has waned.
“The preference share market is in doldrums, with waning investor interest,” said Dilipbhai Diwan, a Mumbai-based chartered accountant and investor. “Many investors had bet on those shares at a premium before the budget announcement. All are now incurring losses with erasing premium.”
The tax levy on dividends goes up to about 35 per cent if any investor’s yearly income is Rs 50 lakh or more.
Preference shares of Tata Capital and L&T Finance Holdings were the most popular among investors. The total outstanding of Tata Cap and L&T Finance preference shares could be about Rs 1,200 crore.

Equity markets witnessed yet another round of across-the-board sell-off on Monday as India, along with many other countries, went into a lockdown to stem the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
Indiabulls Housing Finance and IndusInd Bank have plunged 73 per cent and 71 per cent, respectively, in the last month. Shriram Transport Finance, Equitas Holdings, Ujjivan Financial Services, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services, L&T Financial Holdings from the financial sector were down in the range of 60 per cent and 65 per cent on the BSE.
With COVID-19 related risks rising in India and major cities approaching the brink of shutdown, loans in retail and small and medium enterprises (SME) sector are increasingly looking at risk.
Adopting a cautious approach amid the worldwide outbreak, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have already pulled out a net Rs 62,612 crore from the Indian capital markets in the past one month, exchange data show.
Analysts at JP Morgan believe the current conditions call for a potential ""force majeure"" and the regulators will likely need to allow for a ""moratorium"" on retail and micro, small & medium enterprises (MSME) loans.
Apart from this, a sharp reduction in rates will also be welcome as we believe the system’s capability to transmit it at this point is much better vs. last year thanks to excess liquidity and lower non-performing lending (NPLs), the brokerage firm said in financials update.

Managing liability outflows will be a tightrope walk for NBFCs in the near term
premium
3 min read Last Updated : Apr 01 2020 | 1:56 AM IST
The instant reaction to Friday’s decision by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) of granting a three-month moratorium on all term loans was welcomed by lenders. But with non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) faced with retiring their short-term liabilities, it appears the joy could be short-lived.
Even as lenders may record the interest accrued (from customers) during this period as income (which would not impact their profit and loss statement), the corresponding cash receipt will not flow through as a result of the moratorium. This, in turn, will affect the cash flows of NBFCs, putting further pressure on their asset-liability management (ALM). The most affected would be the one-three month ALM bucket. Some experts believe ALM for up to six months could be affected if cash flows remain impacted.
“While the moratorium provides some relief on the assets side, it is on the liabilities side that challenges emerge for NBFCs with a high share of capital market borrowing,” says Ajit Velonie, director, CRISIL Ratings.
NBFCs such as Bajaj Finance and HDFC fund 45–47 per cent of their liabilities through money market instruments. Those like L&T Finance, Shriram Transport, and Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services dip into bonds and non-convertible debentures to meet 48–53 per cent of their funding needs. Since these instruments have no forbearance, they have to be retired as and when the liability is due for repayment.
Anticipating an ALM mismatch, the RBI has opened up the targeted long-term repo operations of Rs 1 trillion aimed at increasing banks/institutions’ investment appetite for NBFC debt instruments. However, according to a fixed-income head of an AMC, MFs aren’t subscribing to money market instruments of NBFCs in the light of recent crash in the value of liquid funds. “We are seeing increased redemption pressure in this category. This limits us from taking exposure to NBFCs’ money market instruments,” he adds. Fund managers say over the past nine months, their appetite for such capital market instruments have fallen.
Another senior executive, who heads the treasury operations of a private bank, says banks would be on a capital conservation mode. “Now isn’t the time they would want to buy NBFCs’ money market instruments,” he adds. However, for any meaningful participation, he says it’s critical bankers get back on their feet.
Whether the TLTRO will indeed help NBFCs address the ALM mismatch effectively remains questionable.
Unlike 2018’s liquidity crunch, Ananth Narayan, associate professor-finance at SPJIMR, says NBFCs are now facing a problem of perception. “It’s not just a question of liquidity,” he adds. Also in 2018, growth wasn’t as much an issue for NBFCs as it is now. “Back then, NBFCs moderated their growth rate to conserve capital. There was still genuine appetite for loans,” says an analyst tracking NBFCs.
In the current scenario, experts say even if NBFCs slash their lending rates, there aren’t many takers for loans, given the pressure on revenues (of customers).
“If NBFCs cannot offer growth potential, who will give them capital support?” the analyst quoted above questions. Therefore, despite the cost of funds plunging and TLTRO aimed at addressing NBFCs’ short-term ALM mismatch, experts warn that the next three months will be a tough ride for the sector.",review_promoted,sample

S&P Global Ratings has revised the rating outlooks on Axis Bank and ICICI Bank to negative from stable.
“That’s because heightened economic risks facing India’s banking system may affect the creditworthiness of these banks. In our base case, other private sector peers such as HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have stronger asset quality and would be able to withstand the weakness in operating conditions,” it said in a statement.
It also affirmed the ratings on other banks and their outstanding issuances but revised downward its assessment of the Special Agriculture Credit Plans (SACP) of Indian Bank by one notch to ‘bb+’.
Meanwhile, it also lowered the ratings on five NBFCs including Shriram Transport Finance, Bajaj Finance, Mannapuram Finance, Muthoot Finance and Power Finance Corporation.
“Our rating actions reflect NBFCs facing increasing risks from challenging operating conditions stemming from the Covid-19 outbreak. In our view, the economic risk for Indian financial institutions is rising. Economic conditions have turned adverse due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” it said, adding that it also expects the overall impact on the NBFC sector to be more pronounced than on the banking sector, given some of them lend to weaker customers.
Also, NBFCs were already reeling under trust deficit in the system since the 2018 default of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services, it pointed out.
Finance companies also face accentuated liquidity risks, it said, adding that liquidity stress could be high for wholesale lenders with large exposure to property developers, or those without a strong parent, or companies with perceived weak governance.

HDB Financial, the subsidiary of HDFC Bank, was the only firm to raise its full targeted amount of Rs 1,200 crore but the rest had to be content with smaller amounts as rates shot up. HDB’s three-year paper fetched 7.3 per cent.
Vietnam's State Treasury successfully raised 13 trillion dong in its latest government bond auction, a significant increase from the previous week. This auction boosted total government bond sales for the year to 16 trillion dong, primarily funding public investments crucial for economic growth.
Rattled bond market investors started playing it safe after the nationwide shutdown in March increased fears about government finances, economic growth prospects and the viability of many small and medium-sized firms and non-bank lenders.
The Reserve Bank of India has infused liquidity into the market through open market purchases, targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO) and a special window for banks to lend to mutual funds under redemption pressure.
Perpetual Bonds
Though the system is flush with liquidity, banks and other bond market investors have been reluctant to lend forcing yields higher. Investor nervousness has increased since last week after Franklin Templeton shut down six debt schemes after failing to meet a wave of redemptions.
In an ominous sign for financial markets, perpetual bonds or quasi-equity instruments that banks use to raise money too started showing signs of desperate sales with yields spiking 200-300 basis points on Tuesday. Bond yields rise when prices fall.
“Bond investors continue to be risk averse despite several central bank measures,” said Dhawal Dalal, CIO - fixed income at Edelweiss Asset Management Limited. “A number of NBFCs have failed to raise funds in desired quantities and have seen their cost of borrowings trending higher. Investors are demanding higher risk premiums, he added.
Aditya Birla Financial raised Rs 250 crore and could not fully utilise its greenshoe option of Rs 1,300 crore. ICICI Home Finance was able to raise only Rs 220 crore out of the planned Rs 350 crore which includes the greenshoe option.
Bajaj Finance got only Rs 200 crore out of the Rs 2,500 crore (including greenshoe) it wanted to raise, while L&T Finance raised Rs 1,075 crore out of Rs 2,000 crore target.
All bonds of three and five-year maturities sold in the primary market in the past two days offered rates between 7.06 per cent and 7.8 per cent.
Most bids were made at rates over 7.6 per cent and the non-bank borrowers were forced to prune issue size and wait for better times.
“In a crisis scenario, people lose the ability to rationalise,” said Lakshmi Iyer, chief investment officer (debt) & head products, Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund. “They do not distinguish between the haves and the have nots. They end up painting the entire scenario with the same brush. If more banks participate in the MF window offered by RBI, this should help ease the situation,” she added.
Perpetual bonds added to the debt market apprehension. Perpetual bonds of Canara Bank, Union Bank of India and Punjab National Bank changed hands in the secondary market yielding 12.5 per cent,12.95 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively.

“Bankers are worried over the performance of the NBFC credit, so they want an assessment of the actual credit quality of their books and the potential stress build up that could happen,” said a banker privy to the matter. “A tender document have been sent to agencies working in this space, and appointments will be made soon.”
As per the document shared by Bank of Baroda with the specialised monitory agencies, empaneled with the bankers lobby IBA, the scope of work will include assessing the quality of the loan book, further drawing power, end use of funds borrowed, outstanding contingent liabilities, unhedged forex exposure and fraudulent practices of any. These agencies will also assess the present cash flow and its adequacy to conduct business.
From the non-bank lenders which are being assessed Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Housing Finance have the maximum exposure totalling to Rs 1.05 lakh crore, followed by HDB Financial Services at Rs 47,161 crore. The Tata group companies Tata Capital Financial Services, Tata Motors Finance and Tata Capital Housing Finance have a combined exposure of Rs 71,000 crore.
Among the other large exposures that are being assessed, Aditya Birla Finance and Aditya Birla Housing Finance have loans amounting to over Rs 32,000 crore, Fullerton India Credit and Fullerton India Home Finance have outstanding loans of Rs 24,500 crore, Muthoot Finance and it’s Housing arm with loans of nearly Rs 18,000 crore and M&M Finance plus it’s rural housing arm with loans of nearly Rs 24,000 crore.
People in the know said that the coronavirus outbreak, policy changes surrounding moratorium and the complete halt on new bankruptcy cases for year has left little visibility on the health of the business, forcing them to conduct such audits.
“At a time, when the whole system is undergoing stress it becomes important for lenders to monitor utilisation of funds in borrower companies where they have an exposure,” said Jeenendra Bhandari, partner, MGB & Co LLP, a IBA empanelled ASM firm which has been doing similar audits for private equity funds and lenders.
“This is because no one likes surprises and if any corrective action has to be taken or misuse of funds or leakages identified by the auditors, the lenders will get to know well in advance before it becomes a bigger problem or NPA.”

But, according to the Centre’s own estimates, requests for loans worth only ₹9,943 crore are admissible.
Requests for these loans came after the Centre announced that the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and its subsidiary, REC India, will offer soft loans to help Discoms clear dues. Loans worth around ₹90,000 crore were to be given under the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme to help clear Discoms’ dues payable to Central PSU(CPSU) power generation companies (Gencos). The scheme was announced last month.
In fact, the total amount sanctioned till now by the Centre stands at ₹2,500 crore. This has been sanctioned against a ₹5,000 crore working capital loan request from Maharashtra. All other loan requests are under earlier stages of approval, according to information available.
Of the total amount sought by Discoms, ₹24,331 crore is in the form of working capital loans and outside the purview of the Atmanirbhar Bharat programme, according to officials in the know.
Formal application awaited
Uttar Pradesh has sought the highest loan amount of ₹21,500 crore, followed by Telangana, which has sought ₹12,000 crore, data shared by the Ministry showed. However, both these loan estimates are based on discussions and the eligibility of a loan amount shall be checked after the formal submission of a loan application.
As of early this week, Telangana’s proposal is under consideration of the State Energy Department while the UP proposal is under consideration of the State Finance Department. The Ministry expects a formal application for these two large loans by the end of June.
Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Tamil Nadu have put in working capital request loans, according to the Power Ministry. Tamil Nadu has sought the highest amount of ₹15,000 crore. Maharashtra has sought ₹5,000 crore, followed by Bihar at ₹3,524 crore and Uttarakhand at ₹807 crore.

According to the YES Bank petition, Zee group company Living Entertainment Ltd (LEL) had borrowed $50 million from YES Bank in 2016 to buy shares in its own unit Veria International. Goenka had provided guarantees for the loan
Almost a year after promoters of debt-ridden Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) sold 11% stake in the company, YES Bank Ltd has moved the Mumbai High Court, asking it to prevent them from selling any more stake, and stop Zee promoter Punit Goenka from leaving India. Essel group, which includes ZEEL, owes as much as ₹8000 crore to YES Bank, which itself is in the middle of a complicated rescue.
According to the YES Bank petition, Zee group company Living Entertainment Ltd (LEL) had borrowed $50 million from YES Bank in 2016 to buy shares in its own unit Veria International. Goenka had provided guarantees for the loan. Separately, LEL entered into a put option agreement with another group company called ATL Media. Both are based in Mauritius. While LEL procures and supplies health and wellness content, ATL operates 35 TV channels outside India in 170 countries.
Under the put option, if the promoter stake in Zee fell below 30%, ATL must buy up to a 64.38% stake that LEL holds in Veria International, and also repay the loan. After this agreement was made, LEL assigned all its rights, titles and interest under the put option in favour of the trustee on behalf of YES Bank as additional guarantee for the $50 million loan, along with Goenka’s guarantee.
According to YES Bank, after the promoters sold an 11% stake in ZEEL to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund on 31 July 2019, their stake in ZEE fell below 30%, breaching the LEL-YES Bank loan agreement. However, when Yes Bank invoked the put option, ATL declined to purchase the committed 64.38% stake in Veria and transfer $52.5 million to repay the loan.
Additionally, YES Bank also sought an injunction restraining Goenka from leaving the country.

First quarter results of banks and NBFCs reveal that availment of loan moratorium by borrowers is on a declining trend compared to the previous quarter ended March 31, 2020.
These are, however, only initial trends with more results, especially of public sector banks, yet to be announced. Bankers are also cautious and point out that more borrowers could still take the moratorium in coming weeks.
Amitabh Chaudhry, Managing Director and CEO, Axis Bank, also said the moratorium would have to be monitored as borrowers could still opt for it.
Provisioning up
Most banks have increased provisioning and are of the view that a clearer picture would be available only when the moratorium ends. The current moratorium ends on August 31, 2020.
Private sector lender Axis Bank on Tuesday reported a sharp fall in its loan book under moratorium as on June 30, 3030. According to the lender, just 9.7 per cent of its loan book by value was under moratorium at the end of the first quarter compared with 25-28 per cent earlier.
Similarly, Bajaj Finance, in its results declared on Tuesday, also said that ₹21,705 crore or 15.7 per cent of its assets under management of ₹1.38 lakh-crore are under moratorium as on June 30, 2020. It was much higher at ₹38,599 crore or 27.1 of the AUM of ₹1.43 lakh-crore which was under moratorium as on April 30, 2020.
“The reduction was driven by the auto, rural, and SME segments. The conversion of term loans into flexi loans led to about 22 per cent (₹3,600 crore) of overall decline,” said a note by Motilal Oswal on Bajaj Finance, adding that according to the management commentary without the flexi loan conversion, the moratorium rate would have been 18.3 per cent.
Last week HDFC Bank had revealed that nine per cent of its book is under moratorium as on June 30, 2020.
Similarly, Federal Bank too had said the level of moratorium has come down. As on July 12, net moratorium book (excluding gold loans and loans against liquid securities) of the bank was at 24 per cent as against 35 per cent in May.
In the case of Bandhan Bank, the moratorium has been showing a declining trend.
A note by ICICI Securities said that the lender’s moratorium improved from 71 per cent in April to 24 per cent as of July 3, 2020 with micro finance portfolio down from 100 per cent in April 2020 to 30 per cent. However, the mortgage book witnessed marginal increase in moratorium at 15 per cent, it said.
L&T Finance Holdings also reported that the percentage of borrowers opting for moratorium drastically came down in the first quarter this fiscal as against the fourth quarter last fiscal.
“Considerable reduction in portfolio under moratorium for retail products from 79 per cent in March 2020 to 44 per cent in June 2020,” it noted, adding that the overall moratorium for Infrastructure finance, IDF and Real Estate borrowers remained close to 40 per cent.

Rising gold prices have meant that loan-to-value (LTV) is higher by Rs 500 per gram on the same jewellery. Private gilt lender Manappuram Finance MD & CEO V P Nandakumar said, “It is true that we have been seeing a new trend of gold loan customers settling their pledges in order to sell the gold in the scrap market and take advantage of the prevailing high gold price. This trend was at its peak in May, when the lockdown was lifted and branches reopened, and it is gradually coming down over the past two months.”
“Before the lockdown, the LTV stood at Rs 2,850 per gram and currently it stands at Rs 3,350 per gram of 22 carat gold,” Nandakumar said. A good part of the quarter was lost to lockdowns, and with public transport not functioning in most parts, customer footfalls at the branches were low. Therefore, the growth came mostly from existing customers who benefited from the increased LTV driven by increased gold prices. Customers have made use of our digital channels to increase their borrowings against their existing pledges.
An official from City Union Bank said “With the gold price skyrocketing, we see our customers rushing to close their existing gold loans, by which they could borrow at higher against the same gold (jewellery). After deducting the interest, customers will get Rs 5,000 more for every one sovereign of gold (8 gram).”
Karur Vysya Bank has seen gold loan borrowings against the already pledged jewellery go up by 15%-20%. “We do see borrowers keen to take advantage of this rise in gold price, especially with higher demand from farmers in the delta region. However, we have not made any revision on the LTV, as we do not know when the price would crash.”

The Union Cabinet is expected to take up soon a proposal for setting up Credit Guarantee Enhancement Corporation to widen sources of capital for infrastructure financing, sources said.
The Union Cabinet is expected to take up soon a proposal for setting up Credit Guarantee Enhancement Corporation to widen sources of capital for infrastructure financing, sources said.
India requires an investment of whopping Rs 111 lakh crore in infrastructure over the next five years to sustain a healthy economic growth, according to the report of the Task Force on National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP).
To meet the huge funding requirement, Credit Guarantee Enhancement Corporation would be one of the tools for mobilising funds for infrastructure development, sources said.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced in the budget for 2019-20 that Credit Guarantee Enhancement Corporation would be set up to increase sources of capital for infrastructure financing.
To facilitate setting up, the RBI has already notified the regulation for a Credit Guarantee Enhancement Corporation.

The Corporation is likely to be set up as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) with partnership of IIFCL, LIC, PFC, REC and similar other companies, sources said.
A cabinet note for setting up of the proposed corporation is under process, sources added.
The corporation may have an authorised capital of Rs 20,000 crore and will provide guarantee to bonds issued by completed projects.
Credit enhancement helps issuing companies improve their bond ratings, as bond payment is guaranteed to a certain limit. The issuer also gets access to markets at cheaper rates than borrowing from banks.
Availability of long-term infrastructure financing has been a challenge, given the problems faced by banks - asset-liability mismatch and increasing share of stressed assets, a senior official of a public sector financial firm said.
To support the funding of the National Infrastructure Pipeline of Rs 111 lakh crore, the Finance Minister in the Budget speech this year said about Rs 22,000 crore has already been provided.
This would cater for equity support to infrastructure finance companies such as India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (IIFCL) and a subsidiary of National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), the minister had said.
""They would leverage it, as permissible, to create financing pipeline of more than Rs 1,00,000 crore. This would create a major source of long term debt for infrastructure projects and fulfil a long awaited requirement,"" Sitharaman had said.

Put simply, the apex court has confirmed the operation of law of limitation over IBC proceedings and reaffirmed that three-year time period as prescribed under the Limitation Act for recovery of debt would apply for admission of CIRP.
This would mean that financial creditors may not be able to invoke IBC provisions for debt defaults more than three years old, say experts. The Limitation Act provides a time limit within which suits can be initiated against someone by aggrieved parties.
The Supreme Court has while setting aside the orders of both the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in the Veer Gurjar Aluminium Industries Pvt Ltd matter also rejected the CIRP application filed by JM Financial Assets Reconstruction Company Ltd (JM Financial ARC), stating that application is barred by limitation.
JM Financial ARC, as a financial creditor, had in March 2018 filed the application for CIRP for a debt that was defaulted on July 8, 2011. JM Financial ARC was the assignee of the loans and advances extended by the creditor bank in 2007 to Veer Gurjar Aluminium Industries, an Aurangabad-based maker of Aluminium Ingots.
The NCLT had admitted the CIRP application in August 2018, against which Veer Gurjar Aluminium moved NCLAT. NCLAT too later confirmed the NCLT decision, following which the Supreme Court was moved.
The Supreme Court has now outright rejected NCLAT findings on the plea of bar of limitation on two considerations — a) right to apply under Section 7 of the Code accrued only on December 1 2016 when the Code came into force; and (b) period of limitation for recovery of possession of the mortgaged property is 12 years.
Experts’ take
Sandeep Grover, Partner, Ortis Law Offices, said that Supreme Court’s verdict is in tune with its earlier decisions on the issue of the applicability of the Limitation Act on proceedings under IBC.
“Although, some may argue that this decision may adversely impact the resolution process of certain entities and defeat the purpose for which the special code was enacted, however, to my understanding, the Supreme Court has rightly settled the law that if any action is to be taken against a default, the same has to be taken in the specific timeframe as intention of the Code is not to give a new lease of life to debts which are time-barred,” he said.
Vidisha Krishan, Partner, MV Kini & Co, a law firm, said this distinction between the applicable Limitation Act provision for recovery of possession of mortgage property which is much longer I.e. 12 years and the provision for recovery of debt which is 3 years is correct. The intention of the code is not to give a new lease of life to time barred debts, she added.

New Delhi: As much as Rs 70,590 crore worth of credit has been sanctioned to discoms under the liquidity package for payment of dues by these utilities, Parliament was informed on Sunday.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in May this year had announced a Rs 90,000 crore liquidity infusion into cash-strapped discoms for clearing their outstanding dues till March 2020.
Now, the government is in the process of enhancing this package to Rs 1.2 lakh crore factoring in discoms outstanding dues till June this year. Some states had urged the central government to hike this liquidity package by factoring in outstanding dues of April and May as well.
""As against Rs 90,000 crore of liquidity infusion package announced by the government, Rs 70,590 crore worth of loans have been sanctioned and Rs 24,742 crore has already been disbursed/released till September 16, 2020,"" said Power Minister R K Singh in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha.
The government is infusing liquidity in the power sector through Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and REC Ltd to enable the sector to maintain power supplies as cash flows had plummeted during lockdown imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Under this intervention, the REC and PFC are extending special long term transition loans of up to 10 years to discoms for liquidating their outstanding dues of Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Generation (Genco) & Transmission Companies (Transcos), Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and Renewable Energy (RE) generators.
In separate reply to the House, the minister stated that power demand would increase from 1,399.91 billion units (BU) in 2019-20 to 2,047.43 BU in 2026-27.
He also told the House that the peak power demand would increase to 298.77GW in 2026-27 from 200.69GW in 2019-20.

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the former assistant vice-president of RMG Corporate Credit Group at Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Janpath branch, and the regional head
The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the former assistant vice-president of RMG Corporate Credit Group at Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Janpath branch, and the regional head of the bank in connection with misappropriation of fixed deposit funds of Religare Finvest Limited (RFL) to the tune of ₹729 crore, senior police officers said.
Police have identified the two arrested persons as 57-year-old Pradeep Kumar, a resident of Inderpuri and former regional head, and Anjani Kumar, 48, former assistant vice-president and resident of Noida Extension.
Join commissioner of police (Economic Offences Wing) OP Mishra said as per the complaint filed by Manpreet Singh Suri of Religare, in November 2016, his company had placed an amount of ₹400 crore in two fixed deposits (FDs) with the Lakshmi Vilas Bank.
“These FDs were of a short-term tenure,so that they remained free of encumbrances. In January 2017, Religare placed an additional ₹350 crore in two FDs with the bank. These two FDs were also of a short-term tenure,” Mishra said.
He said all four FDs were renewed by Religare from time to time till their maturity in July 2017. On July 31, Religare was shocked to receive an email from Lakshmi Vilas Bank containing the fund statement for Religare’s current account.
“Religare discovered that the bank had credited the proceeds of the FDs to the current account and then debited the cumulative amount of ₹729 crore from the account without any prior intimation to Religare. The bank and the other accused persons had used RFL’s funds for onward lending without due consent,” Mishra said.
He said the bank would have made huge gains from such lending as it held the FDs at an interest rate of 4.5% and had purportedly lent the money further at the interest rate of 10%.
It was further alleged that the bank cheated Religare and misused its public shareholder money entrusted with the bank in its capacity as Religare’s banker, thus causing a wrongful loss to the complainant company to the tune of ₹729 crore, Mishra said.
Religare’s complaint to the EOW named the arrested persons; brothers Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Mohan Singh; their companies RHC Holding Ltd, Ranchem Pvt Ltd and Lakshmi Vilas Bank, its former directors and employees.
During investigation, police found that the bank officials, in collusion with the promoter brothers, deliberately did not complete the mandatory formalities before onward loaning the money to RHC Holding and Ranchem to benefit these companies and to allow the accused persons to square off their liabilities.
“Therefore, following searches, Pradeep Kumar and Anjani Kumar Verma were arrested, “ Mishra said.
Both Singh brothers are lodged in Tihar Jail following their arrest last year by the Enforcement Directorate. In a charge sheet filed in January, the ED had alleged that the brothers used two sets of “conduit companies” to funnel funds from their finance company Religare over eight years. A large part of this money was used to buy properties and there was no intention of repaying the sum, the charge sheet had said.

Kerala-based Dhanlaxmi Bank was put under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework by the RBI in November 2015 due to deteriorating financial health and only last year it came out of these restrictions. Since then it has posted profit.
Bank unions AIBOC and AIBEA have flagged concerns over few developments at Dhanlaxmi Bank and sought immediate corrective measures by the RBI.
In a letter written to RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC) requested the central bank to take appropriate steps in this regard, so that this 92-years-old institution is allowed to grow in its own space catering to its own niche segments.
In a separate letter, All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA) had urged the RBI governor to intervene into the affairs of Dhanlaxmi Bank which it alleged is heading into wrong direction.
Another private lender Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB), which was put under the PCA framework in September 2019, has also come under the RBI's watch.
The RBI on Sunday approved appointment of a three-member Committee of Directors (CoD) to run the daily affairs of Lakshmi Vilas Bank after bank shareholders ousted seven directors of the debt-ridden lender.
This CoD will exercise the discretionary powers of MD & CEO in the ad-interim.

A combination of capital constraints among NBFCs and renewed aggression from public sector banks (PSBs) has led to this situation, said auto financiers. In a bid to grow their retail portfolio, PSU banks are offering auto loans at 7.25% to 7.7% compared to NBFCs whose rates range from 8.75% to 11%.
While State Bank of India (SBI) is offering auto loans starting from 7.7%, others are even cheaper with Central Bank of India offering loans at 7.25%, followed by
Canara Bank (7.3%), United Bank of India (7.4%) and Indian Overseas Bank (7.55%). “In recent times, NBFCs have lost market share to PSU banks, which have become more aggressive and that includes Tata Motor Finance,” said Tata Motors group CFO P B Balaji. Unlike banks, NBFCs rely on wholesale funds. Banks are now going slow in lending to finance companies with RBI encouraging banks to take the co-lending model to take advantage of NBFCs’ network.
According to M Ramaswamy, chief financial officer at Sundaram Finance, banks are flush with liquidity and can bring down rates. “We are facing pressure in some markets, depending on how aggressive they turn. It is a mixed bag for us — we mostly cater to individuals with higher risk profiles and because of our good ratings, our cost of funds has also come down. So, in certain regions, we have lost market share and in others, we have gained,” he said.
Sundaram Finance saw a 20% gap in loan disbursements in the September-ended quarter, 2020. Cholamandalam Investment & Finance Company (CIFC) saw total disbursements decline by 30% year-on-year in its vehicle finance segment for the quarter-ended September 2020, according to research reports of brokerage firm Motilal Oswal. This excludes the tractor and construction equipment (CE) segments.
Shriram Transport Finance disbursed ₹650 crore of loans, which was half of last year. Also, 97% of disbursements were in the used vehicle segment. “Our focus is on individual and small truck owners who prefer to buy used vehicles.

IIFL Finance has halted fresh disbursements for unsecured loans for micro-businesses & personal loans. It has also tightened scrutiny and disbursements for secured loans like loan against property, housing loan and gold loan. According to chief risk officer Sanjeev Srivastav, even in secured advances like loans against property, the company has reduced the loan-to-value ratio to 50-40 per cent from 70 per cent earlier.
Cholamandalam Investment & Finance executive VP & CFO Arulselvan D said, “In Q1, we want to be more cautious. Disbursements will bounce back once the cases decline. It is difficult to predict fresh lending exposure, especially when our employees want to stay safe and protect their families. We hope there is no third Covid wave.” The collection efficiency of loans has reduced from 115 per cent in March to 95 per cent in April 2021. “The severity of lockdown was more visible in April when we saw the impact on collection efficiency. Thus, we have made an additional provision of Rs 350 crore in the March-ended quarter, 2021, considering a probable impact of the second Covid wave,” Arulselvan said.
The head of another NBFC in the wholesale lending business said, “Disbursement in Q1 is likely to be lower than that in Q4. We are trying to do an additional assessment of the impact on the borrower of Covid 2.0. It shall be fair to say that some caution has come in as part of our credit decision making.”
Shriram City Union Finance MD & CEO Y S Chakravarti said that, while it is too early to talk about the company’s performance in Q1FY22, April was a steady month in terms of both disbursements and collections. “Disbursements were comparable to our usual start to any of our first quarters. The localised lockdowns in May are, however, likely to have affected business. But considering that there seems to have been some control exercised over fresh infections in important business locations for us such as Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, we are hopeful that June will look better,” he said.

CBI has filed an FIR against industrialist Gautam Thapar, promoter of the Avantha Group, and several others in connection with an alleged bank fraud case of Rs 466 crore. Thapar and others have been accused of defrauding
Yes Bank by availing a loan which turned into a non-performing asset (NPA).
The agency confirmed that searches were conducted at 14 locations in Delhi and NCR, Lucknow, Secunderabd and Kolkata on Wednesday which led to recovery of incriminating documents and digital evidence.
The action by the bank and the anti graft agency comes promptly in just over a year of the loan turning an NPA and the account being flagged by the lender.
An agency spokesperson said on Wednesday that the CBI had registered a case against two private companies based at Gurugram and Delhi and their directors and promoters apart from some yet to be identified bank officials for causing an alleged loss of Rs 466.51 crore to Yes Bank. “It was alleged that the private company based at Gurugram/Delhi had availed term loan facility of Rs 515 crore from Yes Bank Limited in December, 2017. The loan amount was declared as NPA on October 30, 2019. Further, the borrower was allegedly declared ‘Red Flagged Account’ on March 6, 2020 on the basis of Early Warning Signals (EWS),” the spokesperson said.
He added that the accused and its holding company and their directors committed breach of trust, cheating, criminal conspiracy and forgery for diversion/misappropriation of the public money during 2017-2019. Apart from Thapar, 60, the agency has also named Raghubir Kumar Sharma, Rajendra Kumar Mangal, Tapsi Mahajan, and their companies M/s Oyster Buildwell Pvt Ltd, Avantha Reality Pvt Ltd and unknown officials of Jhabua Power Ltd. Sources said that around twenty locations including the premises of Thapar was searched. Yes Bank had filed a complaint against the accused after a forensic audit revealed misappropriation and diversion of funds.
The accused have been booked under sections of criminal conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust and forgery. Last year, the CBI had filed an FIR against
Rana Kapoor, former MD of Yes Bank, and his family members apart from Gautam Thapar and his Avantha group in connection with the sale-purchase of a prime property on Amrita Shergill Marg in Delhi. Kapoor had been accused of obtaining Rs 307 crore as bribe in the purchase of the bungalow and giving undue credit facilities to the Avantha Group companies",review_promoted,sample

But, this is a temporary phenomenon and it will recover when normalcy returns, our customers are not wilful defaulters.”
Jagdishan also added that they were not looking to monetise HDB Financial in the near future and would wait for the situation to evolve.
“We may try to discover price eventually but in the medium term we would like to wait and see how it recovers when it moves in a normal environment, at that point in time we would look to list it on the exchanges,” he said.

(DHFL) for the cash consideration of Rs 34,250 crores.
The deal marks the first successful resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in the financial services sector and will allow banks the largest recovery of stressed assets.
DHFL had been embroiled in a crisis since 2019 on the back of declining investments, allegations of fraud, and fund diversion, which put its over 100,000 fixed deposit holders at risk of losing their savings. The lender had accumulated debts of almost Rs 85,000 crore before defaulting on payments to its creditors.
Speaking about the deal, Ajay Piramal, Chairman at Piramal Group, said in a press release that this acquisition accelerates the company’s plans to become a leading digitally oriented, diversified financial services conglomerate that focuses on serving the financial needs of the unserved and underserved customers of the country.
However, separateley, he said in a press conference that the closing of the deal marks the end of five rounds of bidding for DHFL, which included bids from both Indian and international companies, including US-based Oaktree Capital. However, the Chairman said the Group was quite confident of the outcome.
""We knew the quality of the asset pretty well and knew to what extent we can go"", he told the press. Talking about the state of the sector, he added that he is ""quite optimistic"", and the group plans to hire about 1,000 people in the near term and scale the number of branches from about 300 to 1,000 in the medium-term. The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had less effect on DHFL collections than the group had previously anticipated, he pointed out, and thus, is not expecting a backlog of bad loans. However, there was little clarity provided to FD holders of DHFL, many of whom were attending the conference. Their questions would be taken up separately, the Chairman said.
Many FD and non-convertible debentures (NCD) holders took to Twitter to voice their concerns. Amit Kumar, one such FD holder wrote in a tweet “my lifetime savings are gone…”. Another NCD holder told Outlook anonymously that depositors are very anxious as they are set to take the maximum haircut as Piramal’s Rs 34,250 crores deal falls short of the debt of nearly Rs 85,000 crores which DHFL had accumulated. Under the current resolution plan, FD holders will receive about Rs 1,241 crores against their admitted claims of about Rs 5,400 crores while NCD holders are also likely to get lower than the admitted claims.
As part of the deal, Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Ltd. (PCHFL) will merge with DHFL. The merged entity will be 100% owned by Piramal Enterprises Ltd.
The total consideration paid by the Piramal Group of Rs 34,250 crores at the completion of the acquisition, includes the cash component of Rs 14,700 crores and issuance of debt instruments of Rs 19,550 crores (10-year NCDs at 6.75% p.a. on a half-yearly basis).
Anand Piramal, Executive Director at Piramal Group said the combined entity will have 301 branches, 2,338 employees and over 1 million lifetime customers. The company will be a dominant player in the fast-growing affordable housing segment.
“This acquisition allows us to implement these technologies across a much larger base of customers. The newly merged entity is poised to be at the forefront of the digital-first retail lending market in India,” he said.
In January 2021, 94% of the creditors of DHFL voted in favor of Piramal’s resolution plan. Approvals were also obtained from the RBI, CCI and NCLT for the completion of this transaction.",review_promoted,sample

Ex-BoB official named administrator of the companies

4 min read Last Updated : Oct 05 2021 | 9:00 AM IST
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Monday superseded the boards of Srei Infrastructure Finance and Srei Equipment Finance, which will be taken for insolvency proceedings owing to governance concern and payment defaults by them.
This is the second instance of the RBI superseding a finance firm’s board. Earlier, it had taken such action in the case of mortgage lender DHFL, which is now after successful resolution under the wing of Piramal Enterprises.
According to estimates, banks have about a Rs 28,000-crore exposure to Srei and bond holders another Rs 18,000 crore. Analysts expect a steep haircut as part of the resolution. A Srei spokesperson said the company was “shocked” at the decision and would pursue all legal options.
In a statement, the RBI said it had appointed Rajneesh Sharma, former chief general manager of Bank of Baroda, administrator of the companies.
It will initiate the process of resolution of the two non-banking financial companies under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Rules, 2019. It will also apply to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for appointing the administrator insolvency resolution professional.
The regulator has appointed a three-member advisory committee to advise the administrator. The members are R Subramaniakumar, former managing director and chief executive officer of Indian Overseas Bank; T T Srinivasaraghavan, former managing director of Sundaram Finance; and Farokh N Subedar, former chief operating officer of Tata Sons.
Subramaniakumar was administrator for the resolution of DHFL. The resolution spanned 18 months before Piramal took control in the last week of September. Appointing an advisory committee for the administrator during the corporate insolvency resolution process is allowed under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
A Srei spokesperson said banks were in control of an escrow account of Srei and they did not notify any default.
According to the spokesperson, Srei had submitted a proposal to pay the full amount to the banks under a scheme. However, the banks have neither accepted the scheme nor proposed a payment schedule acceptable to them, the spokesperson alleged.
Banks have been controlling the company’s cash flow since November 2020, and about Rs 3,000 crore has been collected by them.
“There has never been any delay in loan servicing by Srei in the past before Covid-19 ravaged the country. We are surprised because the NCLT order for all creditors is still in process. There is also an order for ‘no coercive measures’ by the creditors and/or regulators,” the Srei spokesperson said, adding, the group would take “all necessary steps as advised by our lawyers”.
According to a report by CNBC TV-18, a UCO-Bank led consortium of lenders had reached out to the RBI, seeking a DHFL-like resolution for Srei.
Apart from UCO, other banks with substantial exposures to Srei are State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Indian Bank, Punjab National Bank, Axis Bank, Canara Bank, and Union Bank of India.
There was a stay on banks from recognising the exposure to Srei Infrastructure and Srei Equipment as bad debt until a scheme of arrangement was signed by all creditors, including banks and bondholders. That stay was lifted in September, and now banks will earmark the exposure as bad debt.
Several banks may have done it in the September quarter, the CNBC TV-18 report suggested.
What next?
A senior banker said dragging a company to insolvency did not mean a resolution was imminent, or the promoters could not get back the company.
“It is a potent tool in the hands of lenders now. Srei is no stranger to the NCLT either. It has used the platform many times to recover its dues,” said the banker.
While the DHFL resolution took 18 months, the time needed for Srei should not be that long. The RBI did a special audit a year ago, following which Srei had to make provisions for a stressed loan portfolio.

Disclosures and transparency in RPTs are the best disinfectants against their abuse, according to experts

6 min read Last Updated : Feb 24 2022 | 6:08 AM IST
In February 2019, as regulators stepped up scrutiny of corporate governance and business practices in the fraud-hit housing finance company, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation, the resignation letter of one of the independent directors cited allegations of illegal related party transactions (RPTs) involving promoter group companies. Interestingly, in its communication to the stock exchange, the company cited “personal reasons” for the resignation of the independent director.
Few months later, in November 2019, in another fund-crunched group, Zee Entertainment Enterprises, one of the independent directors resigned from the board citing “several instances of poor corporate governance”. Among the reasons mentioned, key ones were guarantees given to subsidiary companies without approval from the board and high level of outstanding receivables from related companies.
That RPTs are susceptible to use and abuse by promoter groups and businesses to siphon off funds is something regulators, policymakers, investigators and board members have been acutely aware of for many years. As a result, the regulatory scrutiny over such transactions has progressively increased over the years. But so has the pushback from companies and business to enhance oversight, citing higher compliance burden, which, they argue, goes against the grain of declared government policy of making it easier to do business.
The script was no different when in November last year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) effected changes in RPT rules (see box). These changes play out over the next two financial years, with the process beginning in April 2022.
With barely a month or so to go for the new rules to come into effect, business lobby groups have upped noise levels on how the added compliance requirements, especially for large business conglomerates with multiple subsidiaries, would slow down the pace of doing business. Experts, however, point out that India’s guide rails for regulating RPTs are in line with global best practices — based on the four pillars of disclosure, prohibition of certain transactions, board approval and shareholder approval.
What tilts the balance is the volume of related transactions that businesses undertake, especially in fast-emerging economies with high levels of corporate ownership concentration. Data from OECD Factbook on Corporate Governance, 2021, points out that corporate ownership of three largest shareholders in 28 out of 45 large jurisdictions was at more than 50 per cent of the company’s equity, with countries such as the United States, Australia, Finland, Canada and United Kingdom showing the least ownership concentration ranging between 33 and 36 per cent. “In the case of India, the ownership concentration of the promoter group goes above 70 per cent for listed groups,” said Kaushik Dutta, director, Thought Arbitrage Research Institute, a Delhi-based think-tank, citing the OECD Factbook. The skewed ownership concentration becomes a challenge as promoters and promoter groups often take concerted actions that hold the potential of abuse, he adds.
Experts say the practical challenge in regulating RPTs is this: To determine if a transaction could potentially benefit a related party at any leg of the transaction can be extremely difficult for the management and for independent directors, with the conclusions seemingly subjective.
“Self-regulation and integrity are the key to any related party transaction and the fate of compliance is in the hands of individuals only,” said J Sundharesan, a board strategist and compliance expert.
Corporate governance experts point out that the biggest challenge for regulators to curb misuse is figuring out non-disclosure of RPTs. “When there is no disclosure at all, or incorrect disclosure, how will the regulator even know that there is any RPT?” asked Shriram Subramanian, founder-director, InGovern Research Services, a proxy advisory firm.
Disclosures and transparency in RPTs are the best disinfectants against their abuse, according to experts. “It is surprising that corporate India thinks that these place additional compliance burdens. This is a bogey …. all these years, companies have chosen to hide RPTs by channelising them through subsidiaries, or by giving loans, Inter Corporate Deposits, and so on, which will now need disclosures,” Subramanian said.
Many independent directors and audit committee members are wary of the enhanced responsibilities for them in the new regulations. Most agree that tightening the rules was par for the course, and something they anticipated. “In the recent past, there have been a number of cases in which promoters of large corporations have engaged in multiple related party transactions by siphoning money to shell foreign companies that were floated as subsidiaries or associate companies,” said Vijaya Sampath, advocate, and an independent director on several boards. “Unfortunately, as always, the majority who comply with the law have to suffer extra scrutiny and processes because of the misdeeds of a few,” she added.
The way forward, according to Shailesh Haribhakti, chairman, Shailesh Haribhakti Associates, is for boards, managements and promoter groups to realise that digital processes and expert guidance are being harnessed all round to ensure compliance in letter and spirit. “The regulators and exchanges are as equipped with digital analytical tools as corporate India is. Information asymmetry or suppression is no longer viable,” said Haribhakti.
Avoidance of conflicts, arm’s-length valuations and business purpose-driven costs create a perception of value in the investing ecosystem, he added.
Haribhakti’s advice to boards is: Be Digital, Diligent, transparent with Disclosures, and Document thoroughly. “These four Ds of RPTs will clean the Augean stables and permit an evolution of high value discovery by the investing ecosystem,” he said.
Sampath raises a point of practice. She said requiring only independent directors to approve RPTs seems like overkill. “Does this mean that non-independent directors who have no interest in a particular transaction cannot be trusted to give an impartial view on RPTs, putting a question on the fiduciary duty of the director’s responsibility?” she asked.
Dutta is of the view that the overall impact of the changes being brought by Sebi could be mixed. Any regulatory tightening, according to him, should try to balance the competing interests of transparency and burden, which in this case seems missing. Experts pointed out that the revised framework has chosen not to provide any exemption to transactions done in the ordinary course of business and on an arm’s length basis. Further, audit committees, typically in large companies that have a large network of subsidiaries and associate firms, could find it difficult to deal with the new requirements.
A principles-based approach, as followed in developed jurisdictions, calls for scrutiny of transactions entered into between promoter groups. However, some experts feel extending the regulations to transactions entered into with subsidiaries goes against the principles of good governance. “The effectiveness of the regulation lies in effective and fast enforcement actions, tracking of suspect transactions using predictive mechanisms to red-flag transactions that can cause harm,” said Dutta.",review_promoted,sample

As many as 54 bids were received for the resolution of RCL and its multiple subsidiaries as of March 25, which was the last date for submission of Expressions of Interest (EoI).
Of those, around 22 EoIs are for RCL as a company, while the rest are for individual or a combination of the company's eight subsidiaries, sources said.
RCL had offered two options to all the bidders. Under the first option, companies could bid for Reliance Capital, including its eight subsidiaries or clusters. The second option gave the companies freedom to bid for its subsidiaries, individually or in a combination, sources said.
Key clusters of RCL are Reliance General Insurance, Reliance Health Insurance, Reliance Nippon Life Insurance, Reliance Asset Reconstruction, and Reliance Securities.
Differences have emerged among the administrator, Committee of Creditors (CoC) and their respective legal advisors over the subsidiaries and their resolution process, sources said, adding that all the subsidiaries of RCL are profit-making entities, well-capitalized and management teams of these businesses are also intact.
Therefore, as per the IBC, no compliant plan can be submitted for these subsidiaries as there is no requirement of turnaround because none of these entities is facing any stress and is a well-run business, they said.
The difference of opinion between the administrator and the CoC on the methodology to be adopted for the sale of these subsidiaries is leading to a delay in the finalisation of the Request for Resolution Plan (RFRP) document, they said.
As per the original timeline, the RFRP was to be issued to all those companies who had submitted EoIs by April 5, but according to sources, the CoC and the administrator are yet to finalise the terms of the RFRP document.
The RFRP document sets the guidelines for the submission and evaluation of the resolution plan for a debtor. The RFRP has to be agreed upon between the administrator and the CoC before it is published to all prospective resolution applicants.
Differences of opinion are over whether to invite price bids for individual clusters under the second option and how to get financial bids for subsidiaries in an IBC-compliant manner.
According to sources, the CoC is intending to force consortium formation on cluster level bidders to submit a company level resolution plan, but the administrator is not in favour of this.
The key concerns of the administrator over this approach are with regard to the mechanism for formation of consortium of cluster level bidders, and who will be responsible for non-performance of those plans.
Many of the RFRP suggestions by the CoC are not compliant with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and hence leading to friction with administrator, sources said.
This is the third large non-banking financial company (NBFC) against which the central bank has initiated bankruptcy proceedings under the IBC. The other two were Srei Group NBFC and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL).
RBI subsequently filed an application for initiation of CIRP against Reliance Capital at the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). There is a three-member advisory committee comprising of the ex-State Bank of India DMD, Sanjeev Nautiyal, former Axis Bank DMD Srinivasan Varadarajan and former MD and CEO of Tata Capital, Praveen P Kadle.
In February this year, the RBI-appointed administrator had invited expressions of interest (EoIs) for the sale of Reliance Capital.

IBBI has now sought public suggestions and inputs by July 5 for effective and expeditious resolution of real estate projects. The objective is to give a better deal to home-buyers, and protect their interests in insolvency situations.
The insolvency regulator’s latest move comes in the wake of representation that real estate projects require different dispensation than normal projects and the resolution of real estate firms should be looked differently than other companies
It maybe noted that despite the IBC amendment in 2018 to clarify the status of allottees of a real estate project as ‘Financial Creditors’, there are now large number of real estate projects under IBC.
Re-looking the regulations
IBBI has now invited suggestions on the need for a separate regulatory framework for home-buyers or what modifications can be brought to the existing regulations within the current framework under the IBC.
Shailesh Poria, Partner, Economic Laws Practice, said that home-buyers have long been at the receiving end of developers being admitted into insolvency. “While the SC elevated their status as Financial Creditors, thereby giving home-buyers a seat on the COC, there was much left to be desired, particularly given the inherent complexities involved in the corporate insolvency resolution of a real estate developer,” he said.
The NCLAT, being alive to the realities, coined the Reverse CIRP in the matter of Umang Realtech to protect home-buyers by limiting CIRP to individual projects. Unfortunately, NCLTs have been averse to adopting the Reverse CIRP, as seen in the most recent ruling by NCLT Chennai in the matter of N Kumar vs. Tata Capital Housing Finance Ltd, where the NCLT found that the IBC does not provide for reverse CIRP and that the approach of NCLAT in Umang Realtech was too fact specific.
“In light of such developments, it is indeed encouraging to see IBBI as the sector regulator taking note of the urgent need to devise separate framework for real estate projects.”
Resolution of realty firms
Kumar Saurabh Singh, Partner, Khaitan & Co, said it is the need of the hour that the resolution of real estate firms are looked differently than other class of companies.
Ashish Gupta, Partner, Chadha & Co, a law firm, said the IBBI move is a long overdue one to protect the interest of home-buyers, given the fact that many real estate projects are either delayed considerably or abandoned by builders, leaving home-buyers high and dry.
A definitive timeline for resolution of home-buyer’s issues must be set and strictly followed, as real estate companies would try to delay the process. The resolution process under IBC should also be aligned with the disputes raised by home-buyers under the RERA Act or with orders that may have been passed by RERA, Gupta added.
Other concerns
The issue of land title should also be addressed, as home-buyers sometimes find themselves confronted with disputes with landowners, with whom they may not have any privity of contract. “It remains to be seen how far IBBI will go to protect the interest of home-buyers,” he said.
Singh said this is also required because of the multiple projects that a real estate company undertakes in the ordinary course of business and each of which have independent set of consumers/buyers associated with them who contribute significantly to the cost of the project.
“Even RERA regulates real estate companies project wise and resolution of these firms in insolvency should also keep this aspect in mind. Another aspect, critical to such resolutions, is that completion of project and delivery of flats/units to home-buyers is the only resolution that meets their interest. So NCLT and the RP/CoC need to take utmost care to expedite the project during CIRP and through eventual resolution,” Singh said.
In order to achieve this, strengthening the arms of home-buyers in CIRP may be useful and would possibly lead to greater monitoring by lenders of real estate projects, so that they know if the company goes into insolvency, they would also need to work with home-buyers for any decision making on the project and its resolution, he added.

The upward revision by the mortgage lender, which is the second hike this month, comes on the heels of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raising the repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.40 per cent on Friday.
The change in the policy rate led to banks either raising lending rates linked to an external benchmark such as the repo or the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR).
“HDFC increases its retail prime lending Rate (RPLR) on housing loans, on which its adjustable rate home loans (ARHL) are benchmarked, by 25 basis points, with effect from August 9,” the largest housing finance company said in a statement.
This is the second hike by the corporation this month after an increase of 25 basis points that came into effect from August 1. The RBI had first raised the repo rate in an off-cycle meeting in May by 40 basis points from 4 per cent.
It was followed by two consecutive revisions of 50 basis points each in the subsequent meetings of the monetary policy committee (MPC). This is the sixth increase undertaken by HDFC in three months. HDFC follows a three-month cycle to reprice its loans — the loans will be revised based on the date of the first disbursement to a customer.
HDFC has also received approval from the National Housing Bank (NHB) for its merger with HDFC Bank, a regulatory filing said on Tuesday. Banks are also expected to raise their deposit rates albeit with a lag after the RBI decision.
Shriram Transport Finance Company has announced that it will raise the fixed deposit rates by up to half a percentage point across tenors with effect from August 10. The new interest rates will apply on deposit tenures between 12 months and 60 months. Account aggregators The RBI has given in-principle approval to eight fintech entities to operate as account aggregators.
Walmart-backed PhonePe Technology Services, NSDL e-governance Services, Tally Account Aggregator Services and Digio Internet have received the approval. The others are Dashboard Account Aggregation Services Pvt Ltd, Unacores AA Solutions Pvt Ltd, Agya Technologies and CRIF Connect.
Already six entities have gone live as aggregators. AA helps banks leverage data acquired digitally through customer consent. It has three key participants— the Financial Information User (FIU), Financial Information Provider (FIP) and the aggregator.
FIP has the individual’s data, while FIU wants the data. The aggregator provides the data with the individual’s consent. The ecosystem eliminates the need for physical documentation in financial transactions such as loans.
Forex services
The RBI has relaxed the norms for small finance banks (SFBs) by allowing them to offer more forex products to their customers. In a notification, the RBI said all the scheduled SFBs, after completion of at least two years of operations as authorised dealer category-II, will be eligible for authorised dealer category-I licence.

The experts also point out that the rate revision by the US Federal Reserve and the central banks of many other countries have taken an aggressive stance on the rate revision.
In a report Emkay Global Financial Services said: ""Clearly, central bankers globally are confronting the classic 'trilemma' of international finance: one cannot have a stable currency, unfettered capital flows, and independent monetary policy all at the same time."" ""In the upcoming credit policy of RBI which is scheduled on Sep 30, 2022, we expect MPC to raise repo rate by another 50bps. We expect rates to increase up till 6-6.25 per cent,"" said Sonal Bandan, economist with Bank of Baroda.
In its recent report, Bank of Baroda said significant risks have emerged for growth and inflation forecasts.
""While risks to growth are driven by slowdown in global growth, risks to inflation are more domestic in nature. Deficient/untimely rain is estimated to have impacted output of rice and pulses,"" Bandan said.
The other developments that RBI would consider are volatility in the currency and bonds market, Bandan said.
Since the last policy, RBI will be evaluating changes in oil prices, trends in inflation, monsoon and sowing, movement of high frequency indicators and global developments.
In a report, Morgan Stanley has also said the MPC is likely to increase the repo rate by 50bps, to 5.9 per cent, with an unchanged stance.
On inflation, Morgan Stanley said it has been range-bound around the 6-7 per cent mark since January 2022 (barring April 2022).
""We expect inflation to remain sticky around 7.1-7.4 per cent in September as well, driven by increases in food prices as per high frequency food price trend. Thereafter, we expect the trend to moderate but remain above 6 per cent until Jan/Feb-23,"" Morgan Stanley's report noted.
According to the report, the inflation outlook is towards on the upside due to uncertainty around food inflation trajectory (sowing for rice, pulses is lower YoY), changes in global commodity prices and possibility of imported inflation if exchange rate weakens amid dollar strength.
With global commodity prices remaining meaningfully above pre-pandemic levels, it exposes the economy to uncertainty especially on external stability.
The trade deficit remained near all-time highs in July and August and the current account deficit is expected to track near 10-year high of 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).
On the current account deficit, Morgan Stanley expects it to narrow to around 3 per cent of GDP in QE Dec-22.
While exports are moderating, healthy domestic demand will likely provide a partial offset to external slowdown.
Morgan Stanley projects a GDP growth at 7 per cent in FY23 and 6.4 per cent in FY24 for India.
""I expect the RBI to hike policy rates by 35-50 basis points to further rein in inflation and in line with global central banks tightening rates. I believe with this hike, we will reach the higher end of the interest rate cycle. Hikes in interest rates beyond this may prove worrisome for long-term borrowers and it may also dampen the consumer demand for the festive season,"" Umesh Revankar, Vice Chairman & Managing Director, Shriram Transport Finance Company Limited said.
India seems to be an outlier with strong demand from consumers, high infrastructure activities, and a resurgence in manufacturing, Revankar added.
According to Emkay Global, the RBI is set to deliver another front-loaded 50bps hike this week.
While there are merits in favoor of a 35bps hike (nascent credit cycle, limited fiscal impulse, and better transmission amid tighter liquidity to name a few), the net cost of soft signalling could turn out to be higher than that of an outright front-loaded 50bps hike at this point, Emkay Global said.
Liquidity tightness would lead to faster and better transmission, implying that the RBI may not get too restrictive and the terminal rate could hover near the estimated real rates, i.e., not more than 100bps hikes ahead.
However, the situation globally is still fluid, and macro assessments might require frequent adjustments ahead from a policy perspective, Emkay Global added.",review_promoted,sample

LIC and EPFO have combined assets under management of Rs 50 lakh crore ($604.87 billion). A commitment of billions of dollars in bonds by two of the biggest funds in the country would be key to filling an estimated $3 trillion investment gap in meeting a 2070 goal for net zero emissions.

""The investment committee of LIC will have the flexibility to tweak their investments accordingly,"" Singh said.
The power ministry has also proposed reducing fees for sovereign guarantees on foreign currency loans taken out by three state-run power financiers from overseas markets at 0.1% to 0.6% against the current 1.2% of the funds being raised.
The power ministry has asked the three power financiers to extend foreign currency loans to Indian borrowers for payment to overseas vendors in order to save hedging costs.
The power ministry has sought allowing the three companies to issue tax-paid bonds, where the issuer pays for taxes instead of the investor to lure investments, the source said.

companies may have to spend more to raise short-term funds via commercial papers as liquidity tightens further and government borrowings of similar tenure increase, analysts said.
Short-term rates, which have been edging higher since the Reserve Bank of India started raising rates last year, have already hit their highest level in over four years because the liquidity deficit in the banking system is seen widening and the government has stepped up borrowing via treasury bills at the end of the financial year.
Earlier this week, state-run financial institution NABARD raised three-month funds at 7.65%, which was over 40 basis points higher than what it paid for a similar paper a month ago.
Shadow lenders Bajaj Finance, Aditya Birla Finance and Tata Capital Financial, which are regular issuers, paid 7.84%-7.90% for a three-month paper, up 20-30 bps in the last two weeks. These rates are at the highest level since October-November 2018.

This is the highest ever NPA for the sector.
Out of this, loans of Rs 37,250 crore were very sticky, remaining unpaid after 180 days of the due date, data from microfinance industry body Sa-Dhan showed.
The data indicate that the recovery from the Covid-stress induced bad loans has almost stopped. Moreover, most of the stressed loans which were restructured in 2021 using a regulatory window have now been slipping into the non-performing category.
""It looks that the recovery from Covid-period stressed assets is very little,"" said Jiji Mammen, executive director of Sa-Dhan.
In contrast, NPAs were 12.5% for small finance banks and 9.28% for NBFC-MFIs.
Bandhan Bank, the country's largest micro lender, wrote-off Rs 2,533 crore of bad loans in the three-month period ended December 2022, even as it reported fresh slippages of Rs 3,265 crore, mostly from its microfinance portfolio. At the end of the quarter, it was carrying Rs 7,600 crore of stressed microfinance loans.
Captains of the industry said the newer micro loan portfolio, generated when life started coming to normalcy after Covid, was performing well.
""Due to aggressive write-off of bad loans and good performance of newer portfolio, the bigger and purebred NBFC-MFIs, which control about three-fourth of the NBFC-MFI pie, have NPAs in the 3-5% range,"" said HP Singh, chairman at Satin Creditcare Network.
Satin's gross NPA was 3.9% at the end of December, an improvement from 8.6% a year back. CreditAccess Grameen’s gross NPA ratio improved to 1.7% from 6%.

Justice Krishnan Ramasamy ordered issuance of NBWs, returnable by March 27, against the managers of Parrys, Kodambakkam and Royapettah branches of CSB since they were not present either in person or had engaged any counsel to represent them before the court. The judge also ordered issuance of a similar warrant against the Managing Director of Gokulam Chit and Finance Company Private Limited at Kodambakkam in Chennai.
Further, he summoned the Superintendent of Police, Economics Offences Wing (EOW), to the court on March 27 to explain whether the investigating agency had succeeded in locating the entire quantity of 309 kg of gold jewellery since the report filed on Monday contained details only about a part of the total quantity. The judge asked Reserve Bank of India (RBI) counsel Chevanan Mohan to assist the court in adjudicating the matter.
In its latest report, the EOW told the court that the prime accused Syed Hifzur Rahman Biyabani, holding a pawnbroker’s licence, had started a firm titled Ruby Royale Jewellers and Bankers at West Mambalam a few years ago and promised interest free gold loan to Muslims. However, the condition was that he would offer only half the value of the gold jewellery as loan. As many as 2,280 people fell prey to his design and pledged their jewels.
He was assisted by Aneezur Rahman, Aruna Rani alias Rihana, Valarmathi alias Shajitha, A.S. Sivagami alias Shakina and Ravi in collecting the jewellery. When the police registered a criminal case against them in 2019 for not returning the jewels to their owners, the prime accused Biyabani filed an insolvency petition in the High Court and obtained favourable orders. Subsequently, the six accused were arrested in Telangana in January 2021 and were released on bail in April 2021.
Further investigation revealed the accused had re-pledged the jewels with various banks, non banking financial corporations that offer gold loans and other pawn brokers. The EOW sleuths had also recovered sale documents with respect to 40 immovable properties owned by the prime accused and five properties that he had taken on rent after paying substantial amount towards security deposit. The value of those properties were being assessed, the agency told the court.
Listing out the places where the jewels had been re-pledged, the EOW said they included three branches of Muthoot Finance, Kumbakonam Mutual Benefit Fund at Mylapore in Chennai, South Indian Bank, Fed Bank Finance and Services Limited, Muthoot Mini Finance and Indian Infoline Finance. The accused had also repledged many jewels with pawn brokers C.P. Jain and his wife Asha Jain of Nandanam who, in turn, had pledged them further with CSB branches.

For example, on the bullet repayment gold loan product, State Bank of India, country’s largest bank, is charging borrowers 8.65 per cent interest for 3 months; 8.70 per cent for 6 months and 8.80 per cent for 12 months. In the case of Muthoot Finance, India’s largest gold finance company, the minimum interest rate starts from 9 per cent, if interest is serviced monthly.
More focus on gold
BK Divakara, Chief Financial Officer, CSB Bank, said that earlier, banks were not focussing on gold loans. Most of them started focussing on this segment a little before the onset of Covid and it gained traction during the pandemic.
“It is a secured product. And even from the capital adequacy point of view, it is a zero risk asset because the collateral is gold,” he said.
He underscored that the rate of interest at which banks offer loan against gold jewellery is far lesser vis-a-vis NBFCs.
“About 50 per cent of NBFCs’ funding is through bank loans. They borrow from banks and lend. So, when NBFCs add their margin, their lending rate becomes high.
“Now since banks themselves are offering gold loans, naturally, their rate of interest will be low,” Divakara said.
Separate vertical for gold loans
Earlier, banks were focussing only on agriculture gold loans because they get classified as agriculture advances within priority sector lending. They were not that keen on general gold loans.
“But now banks have created a separate vertical dedicated to gold loans. They have started recruiting staff from old generation private sector banks and NBFCs so that the gold loans business can be handled very effectively,” Divakara said.
In a recent interaction with businessline, George Alexander Muthoot, Managing Director, Muthoot Finance, acknowledged the increasing competition in the gold loans space, with banks looking to expand their gold loan portfolio and new NBFCs coming into this space.
He emphasised that the trend of others (banks and NBFCs) coming in and trying to take away business will be short-lived.
“This is an operationally intensive business -- collecting gold, storing it, insurance, customer fraud, staff fraud, etc...It is challenging.
“We do our business with our own staff. Banks and others rely on outsourcing. The collateral (gold) is valuable. They are using third parties to collect gold from customer’s house. But our own staff go to the customer’s place,” Muthoot said.

Tata Sons, the holding company of the $150-billion
Tata Group, will have to be ready for a stock market listing by September 2025 with the RBI classifying it as an ‘upper-layer’ NBFC, which requires greater regulatory compliance.
If Tata Sons gets listed, it will be a windfall for its shareholders, including Tata Trusts, headed by Ratan Tata. Tata Sons is estimated to be valued at Rs 11 lakh crore.
If Tata Sons is listed through an IPO at a valuation of Rs 11 lakh crore, a 5% offering would be worth Rs 55,000 crore— India’s biggest public offering.
Tata Sons, led by chairman N Chandrasekaran, had explored the possibility of getting an exemption from the RBI, which first issued the list in September 2022. The RBI on Thursday again released the list of 15 NBFCs in the upper-layer category.
Tata Sons declined to comment. An email sent to Ratan Tata, who is also the chairman emeritus of Tata Sons, didn’t elicit any response till the time of going to press.
According to the RBI, upper-layer NBFCs have to follow a stringent disciplinary structure with a mandatory listing within three years of being notified. The requirement for public listing, akin to those mandated for private banks, is to ensure diffused ownership. Size and interconnectedness are key factors that place an NBFC in the upper layer.
An analyst said that while Tata Sons shares will get converted into a liquid currency through the IPO, there will be a disconnect on the valuation front as investors typically apply a discount to holding companies.
Though Tata Sons has time to comply with the RBI notification, sources said the company could evaluate options, including a reorganisation so that it is excluded from the upper-layer list.
The RBI requires upper-layer NBFCs to prepare a board-approved road map for implementation of its regulations within three months from the date of notification. It is unclear whether the board of Tata Sons has prepared and approved such a plan.
Apart from Tata Sons, its indirect subsidiary, Tata Capital Financial Services, is also included in the list. Tata Sons is merging Tata Capital Financial Services into Tata Capital, which is making itself “listing-ready”. Tata Sons, in its FY23 report, said: “The simplified corporate structure will create a larger unified entity with a stronger capital and asset base, and shall help us move towards a listing-ready structure aligned with the RBI’s regulations.”
In December 2004, Ratan Tata, who was then chairman of Tata Sons, told The Sunday Times in Mauritius that he would like to list the holding company of the conglomerate. “It would not be very different from Berkshire Hathaway (founded by Warren Buffett),” Tata said. He added: “One option was to use funds to buy or grow another TCS-style company and use it as a springboard to float Tata Sons itself.” Tata Sons became aggressive on overseas M&As after 2004, snapping up companies like Corus, Jaguar Land Rover, Eight O’Clock Coffee and British Salt.
In 2017, late Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry said in a court affidavit that his family, the single-largest individual shareholder of the company, had objected to Tata Trusts’ 2014 plan of listing Tata Sons in London. The plan was to issue shares with differential voting rights (bonus non-voting shares) through primary and secondary listings on the LSE. Mistry said he was against the proposal as legacy hotspots were not fully resolved and that shares with differential voting rights were denounced globally as investor-unfriendly. He added that the IPO could be re-looked at a more appropriate time. At a Rs 11-lakh crore valuation, the Mistry family’s 18.4% stake in Tata Sons would be worth just over Rs 2 lakh crore.
In comparison to Tata Sons’ estimated IPO size of Rs 55,000 crore, LIC’s IPO in 2022 was worth Rs 21,000 crore, the biggest listing in India so far, while Paytm’s Rs 18,300-crore offer in 2021 is the second biggest.
In October 2021, the RBI came out with a framework for NBFCs, categorising them into different layers based on certain parameters, after the failure of IL&FS, which was one of India’s largest core investment companies, in late 2018. “The NBFCs classified as upper layer will have to comply with the regulatory provisions as applicable to them,” said J Sagar Associates’ partner Lalit Kumar.",review_promoted,sample

RBI regulations classify the NBFCs into four layers based on the size, activity and perceived risks. The upper layer comprises prominent names like Tata Sons, LIC Housing Finance and Shriram Finance, according to a recent RBI notification.
NBFCs primarily finance their operations through a mix of market borrowing and bank loans, constituting around 75% of total borrowings. According to the analysis, the substantial reliance on banks makes them the largest net borrowers, thus intricately linking them to the broader financial system.
The article pertains to the sector’s performance during the 2022-23 period, up to Q3.
Although there were 9,443 RBI-registered NBFCs as of 31 March, the analysis is based on a sample of 205 firms that regularly submitted returns for all quarters from December 2020 to December 2022. “During the assessment period, NBFCs’ reliance on banks increased steadily due to (the) low interest environment and lag monetary policy transmission,” the article said.
The banks’ share in aggregate NBFC borrowings rose to 35.1% last December, against 29.7% in December 2020, the data cited showed.
While the article was written by RBI officials, it had the usual disclaimer that the views expressed are those of authors and do not reflect the views of the organization. “A deeper analysis highlights the banks’ preference in lending to NBFCs in the upper layer.”
Direct bank borrowings by the upper-layer NBFCs grew steadily in recent quarters, accounting for nearly half of the total borrowings at the end of December 2022. Those in the middle layer relied more on debentures, although their bank borrowings also grew in recent times. Besides, upper-layer NBFCs seem to be more successful in raising short-term debt through commercial papers (CP), it said.
According to the analysis, banks are also key subscribers of the debenture and commercial paper issuances by NBFCs. Therefore, the exposure to the NBFC sector is higher than the quantum indicated by direct lending, it said. “Banks’ exposure to NBFC-UL (upper layer) in particular has been steadily rising, primarily due to a steep growth in their direct lending to these NBFCs in 2022-23 (up to December 2022). Bank subscription to debenture and CP issuances of NBFC-UL are also growing at a robust pace, and reflect banks’ preference for instruments of bigger NBFCs, which in general have strong parentage and are under enhanced regulation.”
The debenture issuances of NBFCs are also subscribed by other market participants such as mutual funds, insurers, retail investors and pension funds. “Going forward, NBFCs need to diversify their funding sources, to reduce excessive reliance on bank borrowings,” the article said.
“They need to develop strong governance and risk management standards and be more vigilant about cybercrimes, as the growing digital lending space offers huge opportunities, but also presents novel challenges,” it added.
A scale-based analysis of the credit allocation by the authors of the article found NBFCs in the upper layer provide a major chunk of their loans to retail borrowers, while those in the middle layer provided a large chunk to the industry. Government NBFCs that fall in the middle layer are large providers of credit to the infrastructure segment of industries, it said.",review_promoted,sample

The decision, unveiled on Wednesday, underscores the company's commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Phoenix ARC, which enjoys backing from Kotak Mahindra Bank, is expected to be the primary acquirer of the 15 accounts being put up for sale. Initially, L&T Finance had proposed a larger portfolio worth Rs 5,293 crore (USD 713 million) covering 16 accounts. However, only 15 accounts were eventually sold, as ARCs displayed limited interest in exposure related to Delhi-NCR realtor Supertech.
This move is part of L&T Finance's ongoing efforts to cleanse its books and effectively manage financial risks. By divesting these distressed assets, the company seeks to reinforce its financial standing in the market.
According to data from InvestingPro, L&T Finance boasts a market capitalisation of USD 3.73 billion and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.41. In the first quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of USD 759.09 million and despite a minor dip in revenue growth, it achieved a gross profit of USD 752.23 million, with a gross profit margin of 99.10 per cent.
InvestingPro Tips emphasise L&T Finance's prominence in the Financial Services industry and its strong returns over the past year. Analysts anticipate the company's net income to grow this year, with a positive profit outlook. This aligns with a significant price uptick observed over the last six months, resulting in a 6-month price total return of 575 per cent, as per InvestingPro data.

Market Experts' Insights
Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities :
Expect heightened volatility as all eyes focus on the release of fourth-quarter U.S. GDP data and the US personal-consumption expenditures (PCE) on Friday, January 26th. Before that, brace for volatility with the January F&O expiry this Thursday. In the previous session, Nifty surged to 21750 but tumbled to 21192.60, causing a significant dent in bullish confidence, mainly attributed to profit booking.
Notably, Zee Entertainment saw a record 30% single-day drop, while concerns over banking stocks persisted due to potential margin strain and sluggish deposit growth. HDFC Bank's 15% decline post Q3 added to market woes. The major negative catalyst: FIIs engaged in a significant selling spree, offloading Rs 22,973 crores in the last week. Investors are closely monitoring Q3 performances of key stocks. Technicals suggest a neutral stance for Nifty and Bank Nifty, with preferred trades outlined. A bearish outlook is identified for TATA COMMUNICATION, CHOLAMANDALAM FINANCE, and DEEPAK NITRITE. The top stock recommendation is to buy INDIAN BANK (CMP 445), with targets at 477/501 and aggressive 15-18 months targets at 651, accompanied by a stop below 347.

Negotiations with Paytm are reportedly underway for a chunk of FASTags, National Common Mobility Card and becoming banking partners for UPI transactions-related businesses but deals are yet to be finalised.
However, ""the basic risk in this opportunity would be the KYC of merchants or client onboarding. If banks take any business, they'll have to re-do KYC because nobody wants to get on the wrong side of the regulator"", according to Kuntal Sur, partnerâ€""risk consulting and leader for financial services and treasury risk management at PwC India.
Paytm is looking to have three banks as a banking partner for smooth UPI services, according to sources.
Yes Bank, Axis Bank, and HDFC Bank are the possible top picks for the fintech major.
The conversations with Yes Bank ""have completed four rounds, and a final decision is expected before March"", said people aware of the matter.
For Paytmâ€™s FASTag business, most banks are looking at becoming acquirers, according to people aware of the matter.
The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) dropped Paytm Payments Bank from the list of authorised banks for FASTag services due to the RBI action.
There is also room to acquire the National Common Mobility Card business. For this, negotiations are reportedly at an advanced stage with the State Bank of India, but a consensus is yet to be reached.
As banks continue their discussions with Paytm, non-bank lenders who had partnerships with Paytm are adopting a wait-and-watch approach, said sources.
According to them, Shriram Finance is awaiting clarity from Paytm on when the lending business will resume. The company may reach out to Axis Bank soon to get some clarity on the situation. Paytm has over 30 crore users, with around 11 crore monthly transacting users. It also has a network of around 1 crore merchants actively accepting payments.
The company has reassured its users that its mobile app, including the QR code, Soundbox and Card Machine will remain operational even after March 15.

Lenders are prohibited from handing out cash loans in excess of 20,000 rupees to customers. NBFCs have been flouting this rule, handing over large cash loans by asking customers to sign an 'indemnity' for accepting liability against income-tax actions
MUMBAI : India's central bank on Wednesday warned some non-bank lenders against disbursing cash loans in excess of the permissible limit of 20,000 rupees ($240), according to two sources and a letter seen by Reuters, a move that is likely to stop large cash payouts to those borrowing against gold.
The central bank's advisory comes within weeks of regulatory action against IIFL Finance, India's second-largest gold loan player, for violation of cash disbursal and other norms.
Retail credit in India has been growing at a rapid clip, with loans against gold rising threefold over the last four years.
A significant portion of gold loans are being disbursed in cash, at least a dozen sources told Reuters.
None of the sources wished to be identified as they are not authorised to speak with the media.
India prohibits lenders from handing out cash loans in excess of 20,000 rupees to customers, as per income tax rules.
Non-bank finance companies (NBFC) have been flouting this rule and have been handing over large cash loans by asking customers to sign an 'indemnity' for accepting liability against income-tax actions, sources told Reuters.
This has resulted in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stepping up vigilance against non-complying lenders to protect customer interest and avoid build up of systemic risk, one of the sources said.
On Wednesday, the RBI's letter reiterated the law.
""Please refer to provisions of Section 269SS of Income Tax Act, 1961, which stipulates that no individual can receive more than 20,000 rupees as loan amount in cash,"" the central bank said.
""Consequently, no NBFC should disburse loan amount in excess of 20,000 rupees in cash.""
The central bank did not immediately respond to an email seeking comments.
Non-bank lenders that give out loan against gold ""have been facing intense competition from smaller players"", pushing them to take ""excessive risks like going above the cash disbursement limit"", a source aware of the central bank's thinking said.
Shares of gold-loan financiers Muthoot Finance and Manappuram Finance fell as much as 2.4% and 4.3%, respectively, after the Reuters reported the advisory.
""The RBI probably wants to limit creation of 'black money' in the system and close any loophole related to existing rules around Income Tax which some NBFCs were possibly violating,"" Amit Khurana, head of equities at Dolat Capital said.

In terms of individual stocks, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Axis Bank were the major contributors to the gains in Nifty 50, rising 1-2 percent. Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel, Titan, and L&T fell 1-3 percent.
Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, highlighted two major areas the market will be eyeing in the budget.
""In the interim budget (Feb 1, 2024) itself, the government has made critical announcements regarding capital expenditure and other initiatives. The market will closely watch their stance on fiscal deficit, especially post-election. If they plan to implement any populist measures and utilize funds for those instead of maintaining the fiscal deficit target at 5 percent, that will be a key focus for the market,"" he said. ""Additionally, any tinkering in the capital gains tax will also be closely monitored,"" Mishra added.

This means that around Rs20,000 crore per month will continue to flow into mutual funds (MFs) which, in turn, needs to find its way into stocks of well-managed companies, with adequate liquidity and at a fair price.
New listings are one way to make it happen. So investors were thrilled at reports that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had ordered Tata Sons Pvt Ltd (Tata Sons), the holding entity of the vast Tata empire to list by September 2025. However, soon after, reports emerged that the Tata group is looking for loopholes to avoid mandatory listing under RBI rules.
Instead, a south Korean company, Hyundai Motor Company India Ltd, will be the biggest initial public offering (IPO) in India, raising around Rs25,000 crore (or US$3 bn --billion) by selling just 17.5% of its equity. And this does not even include all its Indian businesses. There is a positive irony in the fact that Hyundai, coming from a far richer economy, will be the biggest fund-raiser in India’s primary market, surpassing the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) IPO of Rs21,000 crore.
While we wait and see whether RBI and the finance ministry succumb to the Tata group’s persuasion, let us look at whether listing Tata Sons will be a good thing for investors, and from the regulatory and governance perspective. Currently, Tata Trusts hold a 66% stake in Tata Sons, while the Shapoorji Pallonji group (SP group) is the second-largest shareholder, with an 18.37% stake.
Why Does RBI Want Tata Son’s To List?
In September 2018, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), a hydra-headed conglomerate of 347 companies, classified as a systemically important non-banking finance company (NBFC) began to default . The unlisted, main holding company’s shadowy dealings remained undetected by RBI, leading to a severe systemic shock to the financial system. This was followed by revelations of large-scale fraud in Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFC) and Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) and the SREI group, inflicting massive losses on shareholders, depositors and debenture-holders.
In response to the IL&FS collapse, RBI introduced a revised, scale-based regulation (SBR) framework in October 2021, to mitigate systemic risk and improve governance. This divided all NBFCs into four layers, based on their size, activity and perceived riskiness. Ten of India’s largest NBFC’s were classified in the upper layer requiring stricter governance and oversight, since they are systemically important entities. RBI prescribed mandatory listing of these NBFCs in three years which ends in September 2025. Notably, most companies in this category, such as Bajaj Housing Finance, Aditya Birla Finance, L&T Finance, and Tata Capital have either got listed or initiated the process of doing so.
How does Tata Sons Plan To Avoid Listing?
According to a Times of India report, Tata Sons intends to cut its debt of Rs21,909 crore (FY22-23) and seek an exemption from listing. It has already sold Rs9,362 crore worth of share in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to pay off loans. The report puts the book value of its investments in over 14 blue-chip companies at Rs1.3 lakh crore in FY23; it also holds several valuable unlisted entities. If listed, Tata Sons would be among the biggest listed companies in India.
By relinquishing public funds in all forms, Tata Sons apparently hopes to convince RBI that it should escape listing and be considered an unregistered core investment company. This will involve dropping all finance related businesses listed in its articles of association including banking, merchant banking, lending and holding shares, bonds, debentures and providing guarantees.
The question also is: Will Tata Sons really pay back all bank debt, inter-corporate deposits as well as other off-balance sheet exposure and letters of comfort to group entities? The annual report of Tata Sons for FY22-23 shows that it had off-balance sheet exposure of more than Rs15,000 crore with nearly Rs11,400 crore of soft comfort provided to lenders on behalf of its subsidiaries.
Given the enormous direct and indirect influence of Tata Sons on group companies, it is hard to see how it can shed all these businesses and relationships, and if the changes it makes will be drastic enough to be acceptable to the regulator. But more on this later.
Why Is Tata Sons Reluctant To List?
The news agency Reuters says, “One potential worry is that Tata Sons' listing will highlight the special treatment its owners receive, and whether that is still deserved.” The special treatment appears to be two-fold. First, the articles of association of Tata Sons give the Tata Trusts the ability to control is board agenda by requiring an affirmative vote by the nominee directors of the trusts. This will not be permitted under company law, if Tata Sons is listed.
Secondly, at least three Tata trusts set up in 1990—Tata Education Trust, Tata Social Welfare Trust and RD Tata Trust – which have a 10% stake in Tata Sons, do not qualify for exemptions claimed by the older trusts (Dorabji Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust) as part of a grand-fathering agreement. I understand that the audit reports of the three trusts are qualified to note that their investment in the holding company is against the provisions of Section 35 of the Maharashtra Trust Act.
Thirdly, its strained relationship with the SP group continues even after the tragic death of Cyrus Mistry who was treated very shabbily by the group, creating an incentive to have less public scrutiny on its actions.
Should Tata Sons Be Exempted from Listing?
RBI will need to weigh these and several other factors before arriving at a decision. An exemption from listing to the fourth largest NBFC, would call into question the robustness of RBI’s entire SBR framework. IL&FS managed to hide its massive debt, cooked up books, dubious inter-group transaction and round-tripping of funds, primarily because it was hidden from the public eye. Let’s not forget that RBI’s regulation and supervision of IL&FS was questioned by the serious frauds investigation office (SFIO).
Secondly, the issue extends beyond Tata Sons being debt-free. The group holding company has a huge impact on its six major listed entities and unlisted ones, including the newly-acquired Air India. This is clear from S&P Global Ratings (S&P Global), putting six Tata companies on credit watch with positive implications, ahead of a review of the relationship between the group's holding company, Tata Sons and its subsidiaries. This happened on 13th June.
S&P Global says, “The review will assess whether the potential of extraordinary support for the group entities from Tata Sons is greater than what we previously factored. This is due to increasing operational and management linkages within the group. Tata Sons has a record of supporting group entities in events of stress. For example, the group provided material extraordinary financial support to entities such as Tata Teleservices Ltd. and Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd, an erstwhile subsidiary of Tata Power, which has now been merged with Tata Power. We are also undertaking the review because we believe operational integration between Tata Sons and group entities, as well as between group entities, will continue to increase.”
To put it simply, it is globally acknowledged that the symbiotic relationship between Tata Sons and the group is not merely about cutting the debt and letting it remain private. The systemic implication of Tata Sons and its relationship with group entities will continue to remain significant. S&P provides several examples:
A)On the “continued close involvement of Tata Sons in the strategies of group entities”, S&P points out that the holding company led negotiations with the UK government for setting up the battery plant and securing government support for the restructuring of Tata Steel's UK facility.
B)The market value of some of Tata Sons' key holdings has increased significantly over the past few years, says S&P, and thinks that this will lead to improved flexibility for the holding company to support group entities.
C)S&P suggests that if its review concludes that Tata Sons will provide greater support to group entities, it could even enhance their ratings; if it concludes otherwise, it would affirm the existing ratings.
Interestingly, if Tata Sons gives up access to public funds in order to avoid listing, the flip side is that it reduces its flexibility and makes it hugely dependent on dividend income from the big shining star in its portfolio, TCS. This will also impact its ability to ‘support’ group companies more strongly which would prevent any enhancement in their credit rating. The self- imposed constraints of the holding company will affect the unlisted airline companies even more.
Given these factors, will RBI and the government still allow themselves to be convinced that Tata Sons should remain private? On the other hand, the market will eagerly snap up Tata Sons’ shares anytime it decides to list. This is one case where public interest and appropriate application of the rules go hand in hand.
Tata Sons has management control (direct & indirect) on a many large companies which have large borrowings from banks.
It is simply inconceivable that RBI can give it an exception from listing - given that it has forced Bajaj Finance to list their Housing Finance Company on the exchange - inspite of its way lower borrowings from banks and public
This is an interesting case albeit one riddled with too many legal implications. Our laws are a mess, with a lot of leg room for interpretation in corporate laws. My view is we need a total reset in the laws, a complete clean up of the regulatory system (which includes SEBI and every regulatory body under the sun). This is what happens when laws are vague and not clear cut like in Singapore. Laws are supposed to be black and white. Ours is a lot of Shades of Grey, with a lot more questionable shenanigians. If we get to the root problem (which is that our laws suck) we will be able to weed out a lot of problems. Unfortunately, I don't see judicial reforms happening this term (thanks to the weaker mandate in the elections). Putting the onus on corporate governance puts too much pressure on management and regulators alike (and regulators have to cherry pick which cases to fight and which cases not to fight).
Well said. It is high time the special treatment to Tata Sons and the Tata Trusts was ended. As you rightly say ""This is one case where public interest and appropriate application of the rules go hand in hand. "". Fully agree.
Stock inflation: Too much money chasing too few stocks. Why not list Courts, Government departments, Central and States? Most of India's capital and manpower, albeit unproductive is held there:

Funds like India Resurgence Fund (IndiaRF), backed by Piramal Enterprises and Bain Capital, also explored the deal, but eventually decided to withdraw, the people said. US-based PE firm OrbiMed and British International Investment (BII), UK's development finance institution, collectively own a 49% stake in AIMS. Promoter Dr Narendra Kumar Pandey and family hold the rest.
Besides the existing investors, promoters are also selling a minority stake in AIMS with the exact portion subject to the company's final valuation, the people said.
The people cited above said the PE firms have submitted their initial bids.
AIMS has a presence across Noida, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar, comprising a total bed count of around 1,200. Its Faridabad-based super-speciality hospital has about 425 beds.
""This is true that OrbiMed and BII as our previous investors are in the process of exit,"" said a spokesperson for AIMS, without disclosing further details.
Spokespeople at KKR, General Atlantic, India RF, and BII declined comment, while mails sent to OrbiMed and Growtheum Capital did not elicit any response.
General Atlantic plans to buy the stake in AIMS through its recently acquired hospital chain-Ujala Cygnus. In April, the US PE firm took a significant majority stake in Ujala Cygnus Healthcare Services, a 2,500-bed hospital chain in north India that serves tier-II and III cities through a network of 21 hospitals.
General Atlantic also had a minority stake in Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS Hospitals), which it exited recently.
Early this month, KKR acquired about 70% stake in Kerala-based hospital chain Baby Memorial Hospital (BMH) in a deal worth $300 million (₹2,500 crore). It marked the US PE firm's return to the Indian healthcare space two years after exiting Max Healthcare with a fivefold return.
Leveraging the BMH brand, KKR plans to acquire more hospitals of 500-1,000 beds in various cities and create a platform, Akshay Tanna, partner and head of India Private Equity, KKR had said.
