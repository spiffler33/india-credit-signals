# WHY THIS: Mechanical title-based triage before expensive LLM labeling.
# GDELT returns ~74K articles but many are noise (defence news, sports,
# stock tips with entity name matches). This config drives a three-layer
# filter: (1) source domain allowlist, (2) financial keyword check,
# (3) false entity match detection. We err on the side of KEEPING
# borderline articles — better to send 5K to the LLM labeler than miss
# a credit-relevant article about an NBFC default.

# --- Layer 1: Source Domain Filter ---
# Articles from allowed domains pass to keyword check.
# Articles from blocked domains are auto-dropped.
# Articles from unlisted domains go to "review" bucket for manual check.
# Matching is by domain suffix: "indiatimes.com" matches
# "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "realty.economictimes.indiatimes.com", etc.

# Be generous — keep borderline, drop obvious noise (sports, entertainment).
